The declaration refers to the collection, processing, and use of your personal data. Personal data includes your name and address, your e-mail and IP address, and also usage data that can be assigned to you. 

The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to Ventura TRAVEL GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our company would like to inform the public about the nature, scope and purpose of the personal data we collect, use, and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed of their rights by means of this data protection declaration. 

As the controller, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. Nevertheless, Internet-based data transmissions may be subject to security vulnerabilities, so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed.  

For this reason, every data subject is free to transmit personal data to us by alternative means, for example by telephone.

#### f) Pseudonymization
Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separate and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. 

#### g) Controller or data controller
The controller or person responsible for processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

ventura TRAVEL GmbH
Lausitzer Street 31
10999 Berlin
Germany
Tel.: +49 30 6167558 10
E-mail: privacy@venturatravel.org
Website: www.venturatravel.org

#### 3. Name and address of the data protection officer

E-mail: schmieder@lexict.de
Website: www.lexict.de 
Any data subject may contact our data protection officer directly at any time with any questions or suggestions regarding data protection.

#### 4. Cookies and other tracking technologies

The Internet pages of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as HTML5 Local Storage). Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer system via an Internet browser. 

Numerous Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters by which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited Internet pages and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID. 

Through the use of cookies, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting. 

By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized for the user. Cookies enable us, as already mentioned, to recognize the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies does not have to re-enter his or her access data each time he or she visits the website, because this is handled by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online store. The online store remembers the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie. 

The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be fully usable. 

#### 5. Collection of general data and information

The website of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH collects a series of general data and information with each call-up of the website by a data subject or automated system. This general data and information is stored in the log files of the server. The following data may be collected: (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and information that serve to avert danger in the event of attacks on our information technology systems. 

When using these general data and information, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed (1) to deliver the contents of our website correctly, (2) to optimize the contents of our website and the advertising for these, (3) to ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, and (4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyberattack. Therefore, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH analyzes anonymously collected data and information on one hand, and on the other hand, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise so that we can ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from any personal data provided by a data subject. 

#### 6. Registration on our website

The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller by providing personal data. Which personal data is transmitted to the controller in the process results from the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller and for its own purposes. The controller may arrange for the data to be transferred to one or more processors, for example a parcel service provider, who will also use the personal data exclusively for an internal use attributable to the controller. 

By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the data subject, the date as well as the time of registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that only in this way can the misuse of our services be prevented and, if necessary, this data makes it possible to clarify committed crimes. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary for the protection of the data controller. As a matter of principle, this data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a legal obligation to pass it on or the passing on serves the purpose of criminal prosecution. 

The registration of the data subject by voluntarily providing personal data serves the purpose of the controller to offer the data subject content or services which, due to the nature of the matter, can only be offered to registered users. Registered persons are free to modify the personal data provided during registration at any time or to have it completely deleted from the data stock of the controller. 

The controller shall provide any data subject at any time, upon request, with information about what personal data is stored about the data subject. Furthermore, the controller shall correct or delete personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, provided that this does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations. The entire staff of the controller shall be available to the data subject as contact persons in this context. 

#### 7. Subscription to our newsletter

On the website of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter. The personal data transmitted to the controller when the user subscribes to our newsletter will be specified in the input mask used for this purpose. Ventura TRAVEL GmbH informs its customers and business partners at regular intervals by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. The newsletter of our enterprise can basically only be received by the data subject, if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter mailing. For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter dispatch using the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail serves to verify whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject has authorized the receipt of the newsletter. 

When registering for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system used by the data subject at the time of registration, as assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP), as well as the date and time of registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to be able to trace the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later point in time and therefore serves the legal protection of the controller. 

The personal data collected in the context of a registration for the newsletter are used exclusively for sending our newsletter. Furthermore, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a related registration, as could be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter offer or changes in the technical circumstances. No personal data collected as part of the newsletter service will be passed on to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter can be cancelled by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data that the data subject has given us for the newsletter mailing can be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revoking consent, a corresponding link can be found in each newsletter. Furthermore, it is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter mailing directly on the website of the controller at any time or to notify the controller of this in another way. 

#### 8. Newsletter tracking

The newsletters of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in such e-mails that are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and log file analysis. This enables a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by the data subject. 

Such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the newsletter dispatch and to better tailor the content of future newsletters to the interests of the data subject. This personal data will not be disclosed to third parties. Data subjects are entitled at any time to revoke the separate declaration of consent given in this regard via the double opt-in procedure. After revocation, this personal data will be deleted by the controller. Ventura TRAVEL GmbH automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation. 

#### 9. Contact possibility via the website

Based on statutory provisions, the website of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail, by using a contact form, or by using a chat feature, the personal data transmitted by the data subject will be stored automatically. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the controller will be stored for the purposes of processing or contacting the data subject. No disclosure of this personal data to third parties will take place. 

#### 10. Comment function in the blog on the website

Ventura TRAVEL GmbH provides users with the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions to a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a portal maintained on a website, usually publicly viewable, in which one or more persons, called bloggers or web bloggers, can post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blog posts. The blog posts can usually be commented on by third parties. 

If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, in addition to the comments left by the data subject, information on the time of comment entry and the username (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject will be stored and published. Furthermore, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the person concerned is also logged. This storage of the IP address is done for security reasons and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties by posting a comment or posts illegal content. The storage of this personal data is therefore in the controller's own interest, so that the controller could exculpate itself if necessary in the event of an infringement. There is no disclosure of this collected personal data to third parties, unless such disclosure is required by law or serves the legal defense of the controller.

#### 11. Subscription of comments in the blog on the internet site

The comments made on the blog of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH can generally be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, it is possible for a commentator to subscribe to the comments following his or her comment on a specific blog post. 

If a data subject opts for the option to subscribe to comments, the controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail in order to verify in a double opt-in procedure that the owner of the specified e-mail address has indeed opted for this option. The option to subscribe to comments can be terminated at any time. 

#### 12. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data

The controller shall process and store personal data of the data subject only for the period of time necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage or where provided for by the European Directive and Regulation legislator or other legislator in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject. 

If the storage purpose ceases to apply or if a storage period prescribed by the European Directive and Regulation Maker or another competent legislator expires, the personal data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions. 

#### 13. Rights of the data subject

#### a) Right to confirmation
Every data subject has the right granted by the European Directive and Regulation to obtain confirmation from the controller on whether personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.

#### d) Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)
Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directive and Regulation to obtain from the controller the erasure without delay of personal data concerning him or her, where one of the following grounds applies and insofar as the processing is no longer necessary:

- The personal data were collected or otherwise processed for such purposes for which they are no longer necessary.

The employee of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH will arrange for the erasure request to be complied with immediately. 

If the personal data was made public by Ventura TRAVEL GmbH and our company is responsible for it pursuant to Art. 17 Para. 1 GDPR, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH shall implement reasonable measures, including technical measures, to compensate other data controllers for processing the personal data published, taking into account the available technology and the cost of implementation, in order to inform the data subject that he or she has requested from those other data controllers to erase all links to the personal data or copies or replications of the personal data, unless the processing is necessary. The employee of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH will arrange the necessary in individual cases. 

#### e) Right to restriction of processing
Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directive and Regulation to obtain from the controller the restriction of processing where one of the following conditions is met:

- The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
- The processing is unlawful, the data subject objects to the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of the use of the personal data.
- The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but the data subject needs it for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.
- The data subject has objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the GDPR and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.

If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of personal data stored by Ventura TRAVEL GmbH, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. The employee of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH will arrange the restriction of the processing. 

#### f) Right to data portability
Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directive and Regulation to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which have been provided by the data subject to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she also has the right to transmit such data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom the personal data have been provided, provided that the processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR and the processing is carried out by automated means, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. 

Furthermore, when exercising the right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to obtain that the personal data be transferred directly from one controller to another controller where technically feasible and provided that this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals.
In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH. 

#### g) Right to object
Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directive and Regulation to object at any time, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him or her which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions. 

Ventura TRAVEL GmbH shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims. 

If Ventura TRAVEL GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data processed for such marketing. This also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to Ventura TRAVEL GmbH to the processing for direct marketing purposes, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH will no longer process the personal data for these purposes. 

In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is carried out by Ventura TRAVEL GmbH for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. 

In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may directly contact any employee of Ventura TRAVEL GmbH or another employee. Furthermore, the data subject is free to exercise his/her right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC. 

#### h) Automated decisions in individual cases, including profiling

Any data subject concerned by the processing of personal data shall have the right, granted by the European Directive and the Regulation, not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, unless the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and the controller, or (2) is permitted by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and that law contains suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is made with the data subject's explicit consent. 

If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and the data controller, or (2) it is made with the data subject's explicit consent, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, which include at least the right to obtain the data subject's involvement on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision. 

If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated decisions, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. 

#### i) Right to withdraw consent under data protection law
Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European Directive and Regulation Maker, to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data at any time. 

If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. 


#### 14. Data protection during applications and the application process

The controller collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of handling the application procedure. The processing may also take place electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant submits relevant application documents to the controller by electronic means, for example by e-mail or via a web form located on the website. If the controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If the controller does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted two months after notification of the rejection decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the controller conflict with such deletion. Other legitimate interest in this sense is, for example, a duty to provide evidence in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). 

#### 15. Privacy policy on the use and application of Facebook

The controller has integrated components of the company Facebook on this website. Facebook is a social network.

A social network is a social meeting place operated on the Internet, an online community that generally allows users to communicate with each other and interact in virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for sharing opinions and experiences or enables the Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Facebook enables users of the social network to create private profiles, upload photos and network via friend requests, among other things. 

The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The controller of personal data, if a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada, is Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. 

Each time one of the individual pages of this website operated by the data controller is called up and on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Facebook component to download a representation of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. A complete overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE. Within the scope of this technical procedure, Facebook receives knowledge of which specific sub-page of our website is visited by the data subject. 

If the data subject is logged in to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes which specific sub-page of our website the data subject is visiting each time the data subject calls up our website and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned by Facebook to the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject activates one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or if the data subject posts a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores this personal data. 

Facebook always receives information via the Facebook component that the data subject has visited our website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into Facebook at the time of calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to Facebook, he or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her Facebook account before accessing our website. 

The data policy published by Facebook, which can be accessed at https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains which setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, various applications are available that make it possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the data subject to suppress data transmission to Facebook. 

#### 16. Privacy policy on the use and application of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)

The controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the collection, compilation and evaluation of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data on which website a data subject came to a website from (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used for the optimization of a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.
The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. 

The controller uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this additive, the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymized by Google if access to our Internet pages is from a Member State of the European Union or from another State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. 

The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us showing the activities on our website, and to provide other services related to the use of our website. 

Google Analytics sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. By each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which Google uses, among other things, to track the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission calculations. 

By means of the cookie, personal information, for example the access time, the place from which access originated and the frequency of visits to our website by the data subject, is stored. Each time the data subject visits our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose this personal data collected via the technical procedure to third parties. 

The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs. 

Furthermore, the data subject has the possibility to object to the collection of data generated by Google Analytics and related to the use of this website as well as to the processing of this data by Google and to prevent such processing. For this purpose, the data subject must download and install a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about visits to Internet pages may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as an objection. If the information technology system of the data subject is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later point in time, the data subject must reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. Provided that the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the data subject or another person attributable to his or her sphere of control, there is the option of reinstalling or reactivating the browser add-on. 

Further information and the applicable Google privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy and at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html. Google Analytics is explained in more detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/. 


#### 17. Privacy policy on the use and application of Google Remarketing

The controller has integrated Google Remarketing services on this website. Google Remarketing is a function of Google AdWords that allows a company to display advertisements to Internet users who have previously visited the company's website. The integration of Google Remarketing thus allows a company to create user-related advertisements and consequently to display interest-relevant advertisements to the Internet user. 

The operating company of the Google Remarketing services is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. 

The purpose of Google Remarketing is the display of interest-relevant advertising. Google Remarketing enables us to display advertisements via the Google advertising network or to have them displayed on other Internet pages that are tailored to the individual needs and interests of Internet users.
Google Remarketing sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to recognize the visitor to our website when he or she subsequently visits websites that are also members of the Google advertising network. Each time a website is accessed on which the Google Remarketing service has been integrated, the Internet browser of the person concerned automatically identifies itself to Google. Within the scope of this technical procedure, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address or the user's surfing behavior, which Google uses, among other things, to display interest-relevant advertising. 

By means of the cookie, personal information, for example the Internet pages visited by the person concerned, is stored. Each time the data subject visits our website, personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose this personal data collected via the technical procedure to third parties. 

The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs. 

Furthermore, the data subject has the option to object to interest-based advertising by Google. To do this, the data subject must call up the link www.google.de/settings/ads from any of the internet browsers he or she uses and make the desired settings there.
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. 

#### 18. Privacy policy on the use and application of Google AdWords

The controller has integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google AdWords is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to place ads in Google's search engine results as well as in the Google advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to specify certain keywords in advance, by means of which an ad is displayed in Google's search engine results exclusively when the user retrieves a keyword-relevant search result using the search engine. In the Google advertising network, the ads are distributed on topic-relevant websites by means of an automatic algorithm and in compliance with the previously defined keywords. 

The operating company of the Google AdWords services is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

The purpose of Google AdWords is to advertise our website by displaying interest-relevant advertising on the websites of third-party companies and in the search engine results of the Google search engine and to display third-party advertising on our website. 

If a data subject accesses our website via a Google advertisement, a so-called conversion cookie is stored by Google on the data subject's information technology system. What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the data subject. The conversion cookie is used to track whether certain subpages, for example the shopping cart from an online store system, have been called up on our website, provided the cookie has not yet expired. Through the conversion cookie, both we and Google can track whether a data subject who arrived at our website via an AdWords ad generated a sale, i.e. completed or cancelled a purchase of goods. 

The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie are used by Google to compile visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are in turn used by us to determine the total number of users who were referred to us via AdWords ads, i.e. to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads for the future. Neither our company nor other advertisers of Google AdWords receive information from Google by means of which the data subject could be identified.
By means of the conversion cookie, personal information, for example the Internet pages visited by the data subject, is stored. Each time the data subject visits our website, personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose this personal data collected via the technical procedure to third parties. 

The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs. 

Furthermore, the data subject has the option to object to interest-based advertising by Google. To do this, the data subject must call up the link www.google.de/settings/ads from any of the internet browsers he or she uses and make the desired settings there.
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google can be found at www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. 

#### 19. Privacy policy on the use and application of Twitter

The controller has integrated components of Twitter on this website. Twitter is a multilingual publicly accessible microblogging service on which users can publish and disseminate so-called tweets, i.e. short messages limited to 280 characters. These short messages can be accessed by anyone, including people who are not registered with Twitter. However, the tweets are also displayed to the so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are other Twitter users who follow the tweets of a user. Furthermore, Twitter makes it possible to address a broad audience via hashtags, links or retweets. 

The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.

By each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a Twitter component (Twitter button) has been integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Twitter component to download a representation of the corresponding Twitter component from Twitter. Further information on the Twitter buttons can be found at https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. Within the scope of this technical procedure, Twitter receives knowledge of which specific sub-page of our website is visited by the data subject. The purpose of integrating the Twitter component is to enable our users to disseminate the content of this website, to make this website known in the digital world and to increase our visitor numbers. 

If the data subject is logged into Twitter at the same time, Twitter recognizes which specific subpage of our website the data subject is visiting with each call to our website by the data subject and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Twitter component and assigned by Twitter to the respective Twitter account of the data subject. If the data subject activates one of the Twitter buttons integrated on our website, the data and information thus transmitted will be assigned to the personal Twitter user account of the data subject and stored and processed by Twitter. 

Twitter always receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has visited our website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into Twitter at the time of calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Twitter component or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to Twitter, he or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her Twitter account before accessing our website. 

The applicable data protection provisions of Twitter are available at https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=de. 

#### 20. Privacy policy on the use and application of YouTube

The controller has integrated YouTube components on this website. YouTube is an Internet video portal that allows video publishers to post video clips free of charge and other users to view, rate and comment on them, also free of charge. YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, which is why complete film and TV shows, but also music videos, trailers or videos made by users themselves can be accessed via the Internet portal. 

The operating company of YouTube is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. 

By each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a YouTube component (YouTube video) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective YouTube component to download a representation of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube. Further information on YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/ . Within the scope of this technical procedure, YouTube and Google receive knowledge of which specific sub-page of our website is visited by the data subject. 

If the data subject is logged into YouTube at the same time, YouTube recognizes which specific sub-page of our website the data subject is visiting by calling up a sub-page that contains a YouTube video. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the data subject. 

YouTube and Google always receive information via the YouTube component that the data subject has visited our website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into YouTube at the time of calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether the data subject clicks on a YouTube video or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to YouTube and Google, he or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her YouTube account before accessing our website. 

The privacy policy published by YouTube, which can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ , provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google. 

#### 21. Payment method: Privacy policy for Payone as credit card payment method

If you decide to pay for your trip by credit card, your personal data will be transmitted to Payone. The legal basis for the transmission of the data is Article 6 (1) a GDPR (consent) and Article 6 (1) b GDPR (processing for the performance of a contract) from PAYONE GmbH, Lyoner Straße 9, 60528 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Email: privacy@payone.com 

With the credit card payment, you consent to the transmission of your personal data such as name, e-mail address and credit card data, to Payone. What other data is collected by Payone can be found in their privacy policy:
https://docs.payone.com/display/public/PLATFORM/Privacy+Policy 

#### 22. Legal basis of processing

Article 6 I lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for our company for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for a delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which a processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data might become necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were to be injured on our premises and as a result his or her name, age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR.  

Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overridden. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (Recital 47, Sentence 2 GDPR). 

#### 23. Legitimate interests in the processing pursued by the controller or a third party

If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest is the performance of our business activities for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders. 

#### 24. Duration for which the personal data are stored

The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiry of the period, the corresponding data will be routinely deleted, provided that they are no longer required for the performance of the contract or the initiation of the contract. 

#### 25. Legal or contractual requirements for the provision of personal data; necessity for the conclusion of the contract; obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide the data 

We inform you that the provision of personal data is sometimes required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or may also result from contractual regulations (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes, in order to conclude a contract, it may be necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with him or her. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before providing personal data by the data subject, the data subject must contact one of our employees. Our employee will inform the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data, and what the consequences of not providing the personal data would be. 

#### 26. Order processors

We use external service providers (order processors), e.g. for sending newsletters, processing payments by credit card or travel programs. A separate order data processing agreement has been concluded with the service provider to ensure the protection of your personal data. 

Should you wish to have insight to know which service providers we work with, you can request a list from us. To do so, please e-mail us at privacy@venturatravel.org, and we will send you the requested information. 

#### 27. Disclaimer

Despite careful control of the content, we do not assume any liability for all external links on our website. At the time of linking, no illegal content was apparent on the external pages. However, as we have no influence on the current and future design of external sites, we hereby expressly distance ourselves from their content. 

#### 28. Existence of automated decision-making

As a responsible company, we do not use automated decision-making or profiling.
This data protection declaration was created by the data protection declaration generator of DGD Deutsche Gesellschaft für Datenschutz GmbH, which acts as the external data protection officer Dachau, in cooperation with the lawyer for data protection law Christian Solmecke.

Die Erklärung bezieht sich auf die Erhebung, Verarbeitung und Nutzung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten. Zu den personenbezogenen Daten gehören Ihr Name und Ihre Anschrift, Ihre E-Mail- und IP-Adresse, bzw. auch Ihnen zuordenbare anfallende Nutzungsdaten etc.

Die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, beispielsweise des Namens, der Anschrift, E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer einer betroffenen Person, erfolgt stets im Einklang mit der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung und in Übereinstimmung mit den für die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH geltenden landesspezifischen Datenschutzbestimmungen. Mittels dieser Datenschutzerklärung möchte unser Unternehmen die Öffentlichkeit über Art, Umfang und Zweck der von uns erhobenen, genutzten und verarbeiteten personenbezogenen Daten informieren. Ferner werden betroffene Personen mittels dieser Datenschutzerklärung über die ihnen zustehenden Rechte aufgeklärt.

Die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH hat als für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlicher zahlreiche technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen umgesetzt, um einen möglichst lückenlosen Schutz der über diese Internetseite verarbeiteten personenbezogenen Daten sicherzustellen. Dennoch können Internetbasierte Datenübertragungen grundsätzlich Sicherheitslücken aufweisen, sodass ein absoluter Schutz nicht gewährleistet werden kann. Aus diesem Grund steht es jeder betroffenen Person frei, personenbezogene Daten auch auf alternativen Wegen, beispielsweise telefonisch, an uns zu übermitteln.

####  f) Pseudonymisierung
Pseudonymisierung ist die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten in einer Weise, auf welche die personenbezogenen Daten ohne Hinzuziehung zusätzlicher Informationen nicht mehr einer spezifischen betroffenen Person zugeordnet werden können, sofern diese zusätzlichen Informationen gesondert aufbewahrt werden und technischen und organisatorischen Maßnahmen unterliegen, die gewährleisten, dass die personenbezogenen Daten nicht einer identifizierten oder identifizierbaren natürlichen Person zugewiesen werden.
####  g) Verantwortlicher oder für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlicher
Verantwortlicher oder für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlicher ist die natürliche oder juristische Person, Behörde, Einrichtung oder andere Stelle, die allein oder gemeinsam mit anderen über die Zwecke und Mittel der Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten entscheidet.

####  4. Cookies und andere Tracking Technologien

Die Internetseiten der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH verwenden Cookies und andere tracking Technologien (wie z.B. HTML5 Local Storage). Cookies sind Textdateien, welche über einen Internetbrowser auf einem Computersystem abgelegt und gespeichert werden.

Zahlreiche Internetseiten und Server verwenden Cookies. Viele Cookies enthalten eine sogenannte Cookie-ID. Eine Cookie-ID ist eine eindeutige Kennung des Cookies. Sie besteht aus einer Zeichenfolge, durch welche Internetseiten und Server dem konkreten Internetbrowser zugeordnet werden können, in dem das Cookie gespeichert wurde. Dies ermöglicht es den besuchten Internetseiten und Servern, den individuellen Browser der betroffenen Person von anderen Internetbrowsern, die andere Cookies enthalten, zu unterscheiden. Ein bestimmter Internetbrowser kann über die eindeutige Cookie-ID wiedererkannt und identifiziert werden.

Durch den Einsatz von Cookies kann die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH den Nutzern dieser Internetseite nutzerfreundlichere Services bereitstellen, die ohne die Cookie-Setzung nicht möglich wären.

Mittels eines Cookies können die Informationen und Angebote auf unserer Internetseite im Sinne des Benutzers optimiert werden. Cookies ermöglichen uns, wie bereits erwähnt, die Benutzer unserer Internetseite wiederzuerkennen. Zweck dieser Wiedererkennung ist es, den Nutzern die Verwendung unserer Internetseite zu erleichtern. Der Benutzer einer Internetseite, die Cookies verwendet, muss beispielsweise nicht bei jedem Besuch der Internetseite erneut seine Zugangsdaten eingeben, weil dies von der Internetseite und dem auf dem Computersystem des Benutzers abgelegten Cookie übernommen wird. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist das Cookie eines Warenkorbes im Online-Shop. Der Online-Shop merkt sich die Artikel, die ein Kunde in den virtuellen Warenkorb gelegt hat, über ein Cookie.

Die betroffene Person kann die Setzung von Cookies durch unsere Internetseite jederzeit mittels einer entsprechenden Einstellung des genutzten Internetbrowsers verhindern und damit der Setzung von Cookies dauerhaft widersprechen. Ferner können bereits gesetzte Cookies jederzeit über einen Internetbrowser oder andere Softwareprogramme gelöscht werden. Dies ist in allen gängigen Internetbrowsern möglich. Deaktiviert die betroffene Person die Setzung von Cookies in dem genutzten Internetbrowser, sind unter Umständen nicht alle Funktionen unserer Internetseite vollumfänglich nutzbar.

####  5. Erfassung von allgemeinen Daten und Informationen

Die Internetseite der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH erfasst mit jedem Aufruf der Internetseite durch eine betroffene Person oder ein automatisiertes System eine Reihe von allgemeinen Daten und Informationen. Diese allgemeinen Daten und Informationen werden in den Logfiles des Servers gespeichert. Erfasst werden können die (1) verwendeten Browsertypen und Versionen, (2) das vom zugreifenden System verwendete Betriebssystem, (3) die Internetseite, von welcher ein zugreifendes System auf unsere Internetseite gelangt (sogenannte Referrer), (4) die Unterwebseiten, welche über ein zugreifendes System auf unserer Internetseite angesteuert werden, (5) das Datum und die Uhrzeit eines Zugriffs auf die Internetseite, (6) eine Internet-Protokoll-Adresse (IP-Adresse), (7) der Internet-Service-Provider des zugreifenden Systems und (8) sonstige ähnliche Daten und Informationen, die der Gefahrenabwehr im Falle von Angriffen auf unsere informationstechnologischen Systeme dienen.

Bei der Nutzung dieser allgemeinen Daten und Informationen zieht die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH keine Rückschlüsse auf die betroffene Person. Diese Informationen werden vielmehr benötigt, um (1) die Inhalte unserer Internetseite korrekt auszuliefern, (2) die Inhalte unserer Internetseite sowie die Werbung für diese zu optimieren, (3) die dauerhafte Funktionsfähigkeit unserer informationstechnologischen Systeme und der Technik unserer Internetseite zu gewährleisten sowie (4) um Strafverfolgungsbehörden im Falle eines Cyberangriffes die zur Strafverfolgung notwendigen Informationen bereitzustellen. Diese anonym erhobenen Daten und Informationen werden durch die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH daher einerseits statistisch und ferner mit dem Ziel ausgewertet, den Datenschutz und die Datensicherheit in unserem Unternehmen zu erhöhen, um letztlich ein optimales Schutzniveau für die von uns verarbeiteten personenbezogenen Daten sicherzustellen. Die anonymen Daten der Server-Logfiles werden getrennt von allen durch eine betroffene Person angegebenen personenbezogenen Daten gespeichert.

####  6. Registrierung auf unserer Internetseite

Die betroffene Person hat die Möglichkeit, sich auf der Internetseite des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen unter Angabe von personenbezogenen Daten zu registrieren. Welche personenbezogenen Daten dabei an den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen übermittelt werden, ergibt sich aus der jeweiligen Eingabemaske, die für die Registrierung verwendet wird. Die von der betroffenen Person eingegebenen personenbezogenen Daten werden ausschließlich für die interne Verwendung bei dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen und für eigene Zwecke erhoben und gespeichert. Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche kann die Weitergabe an einen oder mehrere Auftragsverarbeiter, beispielsweise einen Paketdienstleister, veranlassen, der die personenbezogenen Daten ebenfalls ausschließlich für eine interne Verwendung, die dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen zuzurechnen ist, nutzt.

Durch eine Registrierung auf der Internetseite des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen wird ferner die vom Internet-Service-Provider (ISP) der betroffenen Person vergebene IP-Adresse, das Datum sowie die Uhrzeit der Registrierung gespeichert. Die Speicherung dieser Daten erfolgt vor dem Hintergrund, dass nur so der Missbrauch unserer Dienste verhindert werden kann, und diese Daten im Bedarfsfall ermöglichen, begangene Straftaten aufzuklären. Insofern ist die Speicherung dieser Daten zur Absicherung des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen erforderlich. Eine Weitergabe dieser Daten an Dritte erfolgt grundsätzlich nicht, sofern keine gesetzliche Pflicht zur Weitergabe besteht oder die Weitergabe der Strafverfolgung dient.

Die Registrierung der betroffenen Person unter freiwilliger Angabe personenbezogener Daten dient dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen dazu, der betroffenen Person Inhalte oder Leistungen anzubieten, die aufgrund der Natur der Sache nur registrierten Benutzern angeboten werden können. Registrierten Personen steht die Möglichkeit frei, die bei der Registrierung angegebenen personenbezogenen Daten jederzeit abzuändern oder vollständig aus dem Datenbestand des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen löschen zu lassen.

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche erteilt jeder betroffenen Person jederzeit auf Anfrage Auskunft darüber, welche personenbezogenen Daten über die betroffene Person gespeichert sind. Ferner berichtigt oder löscht der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche personenbezogene Daten auf Wunsch oder Hinweis der betroffenen Person, soweit dem keine gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungspflichten entgegenstehen. Die Gesamtheit der Mitarbeiter des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen stehen der betroffenen Person in diesem Zusammenhang als Ansprechpartner zur Verfügung.

####  7. Abonnement unseres Newsletters

Auf der Internetseite der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH wird den Benutzern die Möglichkeit eingeräumt, den Newsletter unseres Unternehmens zu abonnieren. Welche personenbezogenen Daten bei der Bestellung des Newsletters an den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen übermittelt werden, ergibt sich aus der hierzu verwendeten Eingabemaske.

Die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH informiert ihre Kunden und Geschäftspartner in regelmäßigen Abständen im Wege eines Newsletters über Angebote des Unternehmens. Der Newsletter unseres Unternehmens kann von der betroffenen Person grundsätzlich nur dann empfangen werden, wenn (1) die betroffene Person über eine gültige E-Mail-Adresse verfügt und (2) die betroffene Person sich für den Newsletterversand registriert. An die von einer betroffenen Person erstmalig für den Newsletterversand eingetragene E-Mail-Adresse wird aus rechtlichen Gründen eine Bestätigungsmail im Double-Opt-In-Verfahren versendet. Diese Bestätigungsmail dient der Überprüfung, ob der Inhaber der E-Mail-Adresse als betroffene Person den Empfang des Newsletters autorisiert hat.

Bei der Anmeldung zum Newsletter speichern wir ferner die vom Internet-Service-Provider (ISP) vergebene IP-Adresse des von der betroffenen Person zum Zeitpunkt der Anmeldung verwendeten Computersystems sowie das Datum und die Uhrzeit der Anmeldung. Die Erhebung dieser Daten ist erforderlich, um den(möglichen) Missbrauch der E-Mail-Adresse einer betroffenen Person zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt nachvollziehen zu können und dient deshalb der rechtlichen Absicherung des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen.

Die im Rahmen einer Anmeldung zum Newsletter erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten werden ausschließlich zum Versand unseres Newsletters verwendet. Ferner könnten Abonnenten des Newsletters per E-Mail informiert werden, sofern dies für den Betrieb des Newsletter-Dienstes oder eine diesbezügliche Registrierung erforderlich ist, wie dies im Falle von Änderungen am Newsletterangebot oder bei der Veränderung der technischen Gegebenheiten der Fall sein könnte. Es erfolgt keine Weitergabe der im Rahmen des Newsletter-Dienstes erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten an Dritte. Das Abonnement unseres Newsletters kann durch die betroffene Person jederzeit gekündigt werden. Die Einwilligung in die Speicherung personenbezogener Daten, die die betroffene Person uns für den Newsletterversand erteilt hat, kann jederzeit widerrufen werden. Zum Zwecke des Widerrufs der Einwilligung findet sich in jedem Newsletter ein entsprechender Link. Ferner besteht die Möglichkeit, sich jederzeit auch direkt auf der Internetseite des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen vom Newsletterversand abzumelden oder dies dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen auf andere Weise mitzuteilen.

####  8. Newsletter-Tracking

Die Newsletter der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH enthalten sogenannte Zählpixel. Ein Zählpixel ist eine Miniaturgrafik, die in solche E-Mails eingebettet wird, welche im HTML-Format versendet werden, um eine Logdatei-Aufzeichnung und eine Logdatei-Analyse zu ermöglichen. Dadurch kann eine statistische Auswertung des Erfolges oder Misserfolges von Online-Marketing-Kampagnen durchgeführt werden. Anhand des eingebetteten Zählpixels kann die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH erkennen, ob und wann eine E-Mail von einer betroffenen Person geöffnet wurde und welche in der E-Mail befindlichen Links von der betroffenen Person aufgerufen wurden.

Solche über die in den Newslettern enthaltenen Zählpixel erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten, werden von dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen gespeichert und ausgewertet, um den Newsletterversand zu optimieren und den Inhalt zukünftiger Newsletter noch besser den Interessen der betroffenen Person anzupassen. Diese personenbezogenen Daten werden nicht an Dritte weitergegeben. Betroffene Personen sind jederzeit berechtigt, die diesbezügliche gesonderte, über das Double-Opt-In-Verfahren abgegebene Einwilligungserklärung zu widerrufen. Nach einem Widerruf werden diese personenbezogenen Daten von dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen gelöscht. Eine Abmeldung vom Erhalt des Newsletters deutet die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH automatisch als Widerruf.

####  9. Kontaktmöglichkeit über die Internetseite

Die Internetseite der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH enthält aufgrund von gesetzlichen Vorschriften Angaben, die eine schnelle elektronische Kontaktaufnahme zu unserem Unternehmen sowie eine unmittelbare Kommunikation mit uns ermöglichen, was ebenfalls eine allgemeine Adresse der sogenannten elektronischen Post (E-Mail-Adresse) umfasst. Sofern eine betroffene Person per Email, über ein Kontaktformular oder über die Chat-Funktion den Kontakt mit dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen aufnimmt, werden die von der betroffenen Person übermittelten personenbezogenen Daten automatisch gespeichert. Solche auf freiwilliger Basis von einer betroffenen Person an den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen übermittelten personenbezogenen Daten werden für Zwecke der Bearbeitung oder der Kontaktaufnahme zur betroffenen Person gespeichert. Es erfolgt keine Weitergabe dieser personenbezogenen Daten an Dritte.

####  10. Kommentarfunktion im Blog auf der Internetseite

Die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH bietet den Nutzern auf einem Blog, der sich auf der Internetseite des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen befindet, die Möglichkeit, individuelle Kommentare zu einzelnen Blog-Beiträgen zu hinterlassen. Ein Blog ist ein auf einer Internetseite geführtes, in der Regel öffentlich einsehbares Portal, in welchem eine oder mehrere Personen, die Blogger oder Web-Blogger genannt werden, Artikel posten oder Gedanken in sogenannten Blogposts niederschreiben können. Die Blogposts können in der Regel von Dritten kommentiert werden.

Hinterlässt eine betroffene Person einen Kommentar in dem auf dieser Internetseite veröffentlichten Blog, werden neben den von der betroffenen Person hinterlassenen Kommentaren auch Angaben zum Zeitpunkt der Kommentareingabe sowie zu dem von der betroffenen Person gewählten Nutzernamen (Pseudonym) gespeichert und veröffentlicht. Ferner wird die vom Internet-Service-Provider (ISP) der betroffenen Person vergebene IP-Adresse mitprotokolliert. Diese Speicherung der IP-Adresse erfolgt aus Sicherheitsgründen und für den Fall, dass die betroffene Person durch einen abgegebenen Kommentar die Rechte Dritter verletzt oder rechtswidrige Inhalte postet. Die Speicherung dieser personenbezogenen Daten erfolgt daher im eigenen Interesse des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen, damit sich dieser im Falle einer Rechtsverletzung gegebenenfalls exkulpieren könnte. Es erfolgt keine Weitergabe dieser erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten an Dritte, sofern eine solche Weitergabe nicht gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist oder der Rechtsverteidigung des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen dient.

####  11. Abonnement von Kommentaren im Blog auf der Internetseite

Die im Blog der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH abgegebenen Kommentare können grundsätzlich von Dritten abonniert werden. Insbesondere besteht die Möglichkeit, dass ein Kommentator die seinem Kommentar nachfolgenden Kommentare zu einem bestimmten Blog-Beitrag abonniert.

Sofern sich eine betroffene Person für die Option entscheidet, Kommentare zu abonnieren, versendet der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche eine automatische Bestätigungsmail, um im Double-Opt-In-Verfahren zu überprüfen, ob sich wirklich der Inhaber der angegebenen E-Mail-Adresse für diese Option entschieden hat. Die Option zum Abonnement von Kommentaren kann jederzeit beendet werden.

####  12. Routinemäßige Löschung und Sperrung von personenbezogenen Daten

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche verarbeitet und speichert personenbezogene Daten der betroffenen Person nur für den Zeitraum, der zur Erreichung des Speicherungszwecks erforderlich ist oder sofern dies durch den Europäischen Richtlinien- und Verordnungsgeber oder einen anderen Gesetzgeber in Gesetzen oder Vorschriften, welchen der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche unterliegt, vorgesehen wurde.

Entfällt der Speicherungszweck oder läuft eine vom Europäischen Richtlinien- und Verordnungsgeber oder einem anderen zuständigen Gesetzgeber vorgeschriebene Speicherfrist ab, werden die personenbezogenen Daten routinemäßig und entsprechend den gesetzlichen Vorschriften gesperrt oder gelöscht.

####  13. Rechte der betroffenen Person

- Die betroffene Person widerruft ihre Einwilligung, auf die sich die Verarbeitung gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe a DS-GVO oder Art. 9 Abs. 2 Buchstabe a DS-GVO stützte, und es fehlt an einer anderweitigen Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung.
- Die betroffene Person legt gemäß Art. 21 Abs. 1 DS-GVO Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung ein, und es liegen keine vorrangigen berechtigten Gründe für die Verarbeitung vor, oder die betroffene Person legt gemäß Art. 21 Abs. 2 DS-GVO Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung ein.

Sofern einer der oben genannten Gründe zutrifft und eine betroffene Person die Löschung von personenbezogenen Daten, die bei der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH gespeichert sind, veranlassen möchte, kann sie sich hierzu jederzeit an einen Mitarbeiter des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen wenden. Der Mitarbeiter der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH wird veranlassen, dass dem Löschverlangen unverzüglich nachgekommen wird.

Wurden die personenbezogenen Daten von der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH öffentlich gemacht und ist unser Unternehmen als Verantwortlicher gemäß Art. 17 Abs. 1 DS-GVO zur Löschung der personenbezogenen Daten verpflichtet, so trifft die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH unter Berücksichtigung der verfügbaren Technologie und der Implementierungskosten angemessene Maßnahmen, auch technischer Art, um andere für die Datenverarbeitung Verantwortliche, welche die veröffentlichten personenbezogenen Daten verarbeiten, darüber in Kenntnis zu setzen, dass die betroffene Person von diesen anderen für die Datenverarbeitung Verantwortlichen die Löschung sämtlicher Links zu diesen personenbezogenen Daten oder von Kopien oder Replikationen dieser personenbezogenen Daten verlangt hat, soweit die Verarbeitung nicht erforderlich ist. Der Mitarbeiter der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH wird im Einzelfall das Notwendige veranlassen.

- Die Verarbeitung ist unrechtmäßig, die betroffene Person lehnt die Löschung der personenbezogenen Daten ab und verlangt stattdessen die Einschränkung der Nutzung der personenbezogenen Daten.
- Der Verantwortliche benötigt die personenbezogenen Daten für die Zwecke der Verarbeitung nicht länger, die betroffene Person benötigt sie jedoch zur Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen.
- Die betroffene Person hat Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung gem. Art. 21 Abs. 1 DS-GVO eingelegt und es steht noch nicht fest, ob die berechtigten Gründe des Verantwortlichen gegenüber denen der betroffenen Person überwiegen.

Sofern eine der oben genannten Voraussetzungen gegeben ist und eine betroffene Person die Einschränkung von personenbezogenen Daten, die bei der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH gespeichert sind, verlangen möchte, kann sie sich hierzu jederzeit an einen Mitarbeiter des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen wenden. Der Mitarbeiter der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH wird die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung veranlassen.

####  f) Recht auf Datenübertragbarkeit
Jede von der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten betroffene Person hat das vom Europäischen Richtlinien- und Verordnungsgeber gewährte Recht, die sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten, welche durch die betroffene Person einem Verantwortlichen bereitgestellt wurden, in einem strukturierten, gängigen und maschinenlesbaren Format zu erhalten. Sie hat außerdem das Recht, diese Daten einem anderen Verantwortlichen ohne Behinderung durch den Verantwortlichen, dem die personenbezogenen Daten bereitgestellt wurden, zu übermitteln, sofern die Verarbeitung auf der Einwilligung gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe a DS-GVO oder Art. 9 Abs. 2 Buchstabe a DS-GVO oder auf einem Vertrag gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe b DS-GVO beruht und die Verarbeitung mithilfe automatisierter Verfahren erfolgt, sofern die Verarbeitung nicht für die Wahrnehmung einer Aufgabe erforderlich ist, die im öffentlichen Interesse liegt oder in Ausübung öffentlicher Gewalt erfolgt, welche dem Verantwortlichen übertragen wurde.

Ferner hat die betroffene Person bei der Ausübung ihres Rechts auf Datenübertragbarkeit gemäß Art. 20 Abs. 1 DS-GVO das Recht, zu erwirken, dass die personenbezogenen Daten direkt von einem Verantwortlichen an einen anderen Verantwortlichen übermittelt werden, soweit dies technisch machbar ist und sofern hiervon nicht die Rechte und Freiheiten anderer Personen beeinträchtigt werden.

####  g) Recht auf Widerspruch
Jede von der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten betroffene Person hat das vom Europäischen Richtlinien- und Verordnungsgeber gewährte Recht, aus Gründen, die sich aus ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben, jederzeit gegen die Verarbeitung sie betreffender personenbezogener Daten, die aufgrund von Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstaben e oder f DS-GVO erfolgt, Widerspruch einzulegen. Dies gilt auch für ein auf diese Bestimmungen gestütztes Profiling.

Die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH verarbeitet die personenbezogenen Daten im Falle des Widerspruchs nicht mehr, es sei denn, wir können zwingende schutzwürdige Gründe für die Verarbeitung nachweisen, die den Interessen, Rechten und Freiheiten der betroffenen Person überwiegen, oder die Verarbeitung dient der Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen.

Verarbeitet die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH personenbezogene Daten, um Direktwerbung zu betreiben, so hat die betroffene Person das Recht, jederzeit Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung der personenbezogenen Daten zum Zwecke derartiger Werbung einzulegen. Dies gilt auch für das Profiling, soweit es mit solcher Direktwerbung in Verbindung steht. Widerspricht die betroffene Person gegenüber der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH der Verarbeitung für Zwecke der Direktwerbung, so wird die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH die personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr für diese Zwecke verarbeiten.

Zudem hat die betroffene Person das Recht, aus Gründen, die sich aus ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben, gegen die sie betreffende Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, die bei der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH zu wissenschaftlichen oder historischen Forschungszwecken oder zu statistischen Zwecken gemäß Art. 89 Abs. 1 DS-GVO erfolgen, Widerspruch einzulegen, es sei denn, eine solche Verarbeitung ist zur Erfüllung einer im öffentlichen Interesse liegenden Aufgabe erforderlich.

Zur Ausübung des Rechts auf Widerspruch kann sich die betroffene Person direkt jeden Mitarbeiter der Ventura TRAVEL GmbH oder einen anderen Mitarbeiter wenden. Der betroffenen Person steht es ferner frei, im Zusammenhang mit der Nutzung von Diensten der Informationsgesellschaft, ungeachtet der Richtlinie 2002/58/EG, ihr Widerspruchsrecht mittels automatisierter Verfahren auszuüben, bei denen technische Spezifikationen verwendet werden.

####  h) Automatisierte Entscheidungen im Einzelfall einschließlich Profiling
Jede von der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten betroffene Person hat das vom Europäischen Richtlinien- und Verordnungsgeber gewährte Recht, nicht einer ausschließlich auf einer automatisierten Verarbeitung — einschließlich Profiling — beruhenden Entscheidung unterworfen zu werden, die ihr gegenüber rechtliche Wirkung entfaltet oder sie in ähnlicher Weise erheblich beeinträchtigt, sofern die Entscheidung (1) nicht für den Abschluss oder die Erfüllung eines Vertrags zwischen der betroffenen Person und dem Verantwortlichen erforderlich ist, oder (2) aufgrund von Rechtsvorschriften der Union oder der Mitgliedstaaten, denen der Verantwortliche unterliegt, zulässig ist und diese Rechtsvorschriften angemessene Maßnahmen zur Wahrung der Rechte und Freiheiten sowie der berechtigten Interessen der betroffenen Person enthalten oder (3) mit ausdrücklicher Einwilligung der betroffenen Person erfolgt.

Ist die Entscheidung (1) für den Abschluss oder die Erfüllung eines Vertrags zwischen der betroffenen Person und dem Verantwortlichen erforderlich oder (2) erfolgt sie mit ausdrücklicher Einwilligung der betroffenen Person, trifft die Ventura TRAVEL GmbH angemessene Maßnahmen, um die Rechte und Freiheiten sowie die berechtigten Interessen der betroffenen Person zu wahren, wozu mindestens das Recht auf Erwirkung des Eingreifens einer Person seitens des Verantwortlichen, auf Darlegung des eigenen Standpunkts und auf Anfechtung der Entscheidung gehört.

Möchte die betroffene Person Rechte mit Bezug auf automatisierte Entscheidungen geltend machen, kann sie sich hierzu jederzeit an einen Mitarbeiter des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen wenden.

####  14. Datenschutz bei Bewerbungen und im Bewerbungsverfahren

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche erhebt und verarbeitet die personenbezogenen Daten von Bewerbern zum Zwecke der Abwicklung des Bewerbungsverfahrens. Die Verarbeitung kann auch auf elektronischem Wege erfolgen. Dies ist insbesondere dann der Fall, wenn ein Bewerber entsprechende Bewerbungsunterlagen auf dem elektronischen Wege, beispielsweise per E-Mail oder über ein auf der Internetseite befindliches Webformular, an den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen übermittelt. Schließt der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche einen Anstellungsvertrag mit einem Bewerber, werden die übermittelten Daten zum Zwecke der Abwicklung des Beschäftigungsverhältnisses unter Beachtung der gesetzlichen Vorschriften gespeichert. Wird von dem für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen kein Anstellungsvertrag mit dem Bewerber geschlossen, so werden die Bewerbungsunterlagen zwei Monate nach Bekanntgabe der Absageentscheidung automatisch gelöscht, sofern einer Löschung keine sonstigen berechtigten Interessen des für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen entgegenstehen. Sonstiges berechtigtes Interesse in diesem Sinne ist beispielsweise eine Beweispflicht in einem Verfahren nach dem Allgemeinen Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (AGG).

####  15. Datenschutzbestimmungen zu Einsatz und Verwendung von Facebook

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche hat auf dieser Internetseite Komponenten des Unternehmens Facebook integriert. Facebook ist ein soziales Netzwerk.
Ein soziales Netzwerk ist ein im Internet betriebener sozialer Treffpunkt, eine Online-Gemeinschaft, die es den Nutzern in der Regel ermöglicht, untereinander zu kommunizieren und im virtuellen Raum zu interagieren. Ein soziales Netzwerk kann als Plattform zum Austausch von Meinungen und Erfahrungen dienen oder ermöglicht es der Internetgemeinschaft, persönliche oder unternehmensbezogene Informationen bereitzustellen. Facebook ermöglicht den Nutzern des sozialen Netzwerkes unter anderem die Erstellung von privaten Profilen, den Upload von Fotos und eine Vernetzung über Freundschaftsanfragen.

Betreibergesellschaft von Facebook ist die Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. Für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten Verantwortlicher ist, wenn eine betroffene Person außerhalb der USA oder Kanada lebt, die Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.

Durch jeden Aufruf einer der Einzelseiten dieser Internetseite, die durch den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen betrieben wird und auf welcher eine Facebook-Komponente (Facebook-Plug-In) integriert wurde, wird der Internetbrowser auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person automatisch durch die jeweilige Facebook-Komponente veranlasst, eine Darstellung der entsprechenden Facebook-Komponente von Facebook herunterzuladen. Eine Gesamtübersicht über alle Facebook-Plug-Ins kann unter https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE abgerufen werden. Im Rahmen dieses technischen Verfahrens erhält Facebook Kenntnis darüber, welche konkrete Unterseite unserer Internetseite durch die betroffene Person besucht wird.

Sofern die betroffene Person gleichzeitig bei Facebook eingeloggt ist, erkennt Facebook mit jedem Aufruf unserer Internetseite durch die betroffene Person und während der gesamten Dauer des jeweiligen Aufenthaltes auf unserer Internetseite, welche konkrete Unterseite unserer Internetseite die betroffene Person besucht. Diese Informationen werden durch die Facebook-Komponente gesammelt und durch Facebook dem jeweiligen Facebook-Account der betroffenen Person zugeordnet. Betätigt die betroffene Person einen der auf unserer Internetseite integrierten Facebook-Buttons, beispielsweise den „Gefällt mir"-Button, oder gibt die betroffene Person einen Kommentar ab, ordnet Facebook diese Information dem persönlichen Facebook-Benutzerkonto der betroffenen Person zu und speichert diese personenbezogenen Daten.

Facebook erhält über die Facebook-Komponente immer dann eine Information darüber, dass die betroffene Person unsere Internetseite besucht hat, wenn die betroffene Person zum Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs unserer Internetseite gleichzeitig bei Facebook eingeloggt ist; dies findet unabhängig davon statt, ob die betroffene Person die Facebook-Komponente anklickt oder nicht. Ist eine derartige Übermittlung dieser Informationen an Facebook von der betroffenen Person nicht gewollt, kann diese die Übermittlung dadurch verhindern, dass sie sich vor einem Aufruf unserer Internetseite aus ihrem Facebook-Account ausloggt.

Die von Facebook veröffentlichte Datenrichtlinie, die unter https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/ abrufbar ist, gibt Aufschluss über die Erhebung, Verarbeitung und Nutzung personenbezogener Daten durch Facebook. Ferner wird dort erläutert, welche Einstellungsmöglichkeiten Facebook zum Schutz der Privatsphäre der betroffenen Person bietet. Zudem sind unterschiedliche Applikationen erhältlich, die es ermöglichen, eine Datenübermittlung an Facebook zu unterdrücken. Solche Applikationen können durch die betroffene Person genutzt werden, um eine Datenübermittlung an Facebook zu unterdrücken.

####  16. Datenschutzbestimmungen zu Einsatz und Verwendung von Google Analytics (mit Anonymisierungsfunktion)

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche hat auf dieser Internetseite die Komponente Google Analytics (mit Anonymisierungsfunktion) integriert. Google Analytics ist ein Web-Analyse-Dienst. Web-Analyse ist die Erhebung, Sammlung und Auswertung von Daten über das Verhalten von Besuchern von Internetseiten. Ein Web-Analyse-Dienst erfasst unter anderem Daten darüber, von welcher Internetseite eine betroffene Person auf eine Internetseite gekommen ist (sogenannte Referrer), auf welche Unterseiten der Internetseite zugegriffen oder wie oft und für welche Verweildauer eine Unterseite betrachtet wurde. Eine Web-Analyse wird überwiegend zur Optimierung einer Internetseite und zur Kosten-Nutzen-Analyse von Internetwerbung eingesetzt.

Betreibergesellschaft der Google-Analytics-Komponente ist die Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche verwendet für die Web-Analyse über Google Analytics den Zusatz "_gat._anonymizeIp". Mittels dieses Zusatzes wird die IP-Adresse des Internetanschlusses der betroffenen Person von Google gekürzt und anonymisiert, wenn der Zugriff auf unsere Internetseiten aus einem Mitgliedstaat der Europäischen Union oder aus einem anderen Vertragsstaat des Abkommens über den Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum erfolgt.

Der Zweck der Google-Analytics-Komponente ist die Analyse der Besucherströme auf unserer Internetseite. Google nutzt die gewonnenen Daten und Informationen unter anderem dazu, die Nutzung unserer Internetseite auszuwerten, um für uns Online-Reports, welche die Aktivitäten auf unseren Internetseiten aufzeigen, zusammenzustellen, und um weitere mit der Nutzung unserer Internetseite in Verbindung stehende Dienstleistungen zu erbringen.

Google Analytics setzt ein Cookie auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person. Was Cookies sind, wurde oben bereits erläutert. Mit Setzung des Cookies wird Google eine Analyse der Benutzung unserer Internetseite ermöglicht. Durch jeden Aufruf einer der Einzelseiten dieser Internetseite, die durch den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen betrieben wird und auf welcher eine Google-Analytics-Komponente integriert wurde, wird der Internetbrowser auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person automatisch durch die jeweilige Google-Analytics-Komponente veranlasst, Daten zum Zwecke der Online-Analyse an Google zu übermitteln. Im Rahmen dieses technischen Verfahrens erhält Google Kenntnis über personenbezogene Daten, wie der IP-Adresse der betroffenen Person, die Google unter anderem dazu dienen, die Herkunft der Besucher und Klicks nachzuvollziehen und in der Folge Provisionsabrechnungen zu ermöglichen.

Mittels des Cookies werden personenbezogene Informationen, beispielsweise die Zugriffszeit, der Ort, von welchem ein Zugriff ausging und die Häufigkeit der Besuche unserer Internetseite durch die betroffene Person, gespeichert. Bei jedem Besuch unserer Internetseiten werden diese personenbezogenen Daten, einschließlich der IP-Adresse des von der betroffenen Person genutzten Internetanschlusses, an Google in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika übertragen. Diese personenbezogenen Daten werden durch Google in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika gespeichert. Google gibt diese über das technische Verfahren erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten unter Umständen an Dritte weiter.
Die betroffene Person kann die Setzung von Cookies durch unsere Internetseite, wie oben bereits dargestellt, jederzeit mittels einer entsprechenden Einstellung des genutzten Internetbrowsers verhindern und damit der Setzung von Cookies dauerhaft widersprechen. Eine solche Einstellung des genutzten Internetbrowsers würde auch verhindern, dass Google ein Cookie auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person setzt. Zudem kann ein von Google Analytics bereits gesetzter Cookie jederzeit über den Internetbrowser oder andere Softwareprogramme gelöscht werden.

Ferner besteht für die betroffene Person die Möglichkeit, einer Erfassung der durch Google Analytics erzeugten, auf eine Nutzung dieser Internetseite bezogenen Daten sowie der Verarbeitung dieser Daten durch Google zu widersprechen und eine solche zu verhindern. Hierzu muss die betroffene Person ein Browser-Add-On unter dem Link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout herunterladen und installieren. Dieses Browser-Add-On teilt Google Analytics über JavaScript mit, dass keine Daten und Informationen zu den Besuchen von Internetseiten an Google Analytics übermittelt werden dürfen. Die Installation des Browser-Add-Ons wird von Google als Widerspruch gewertet.

Wird das informationstechnologische System der betroffenen Person zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt gelöscht, formatiert oder neu installiert, muss durch die betroffene Person eine erneute Installation des Browser-Add-Ons erfolgen, um Google Analytics zu deaktivieren. Sofern das Browser-Add-On durch die betroffene Person oder einer anderen Person, die ihrem Machtbereich zuzurechnen ist, deinstalliert oder deaktiviert wird, besteht die Möglichkeit der Neuinstallation oder der erneuten Aktivierung des Browser-Add-Ons.

Weitere Informationen und die geltenden Datenschutzbestimmungen von Google können unter https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ und unter http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html abgerufen werden. Google Analytics wird unter diesem Link https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/ genauer erläutert.

####  17. Datenschutzbestimmungen zu Einsatz und Verwendung von Google Remarketing

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche hat auf dieser Internetseite Dienste von Google Remarketing integriert. Google Remarketing ist eine Funktion von Google-AdWords, die es einem Unternehmen ermöglicht, bei solchen Internetnutzern Werbung einblenden zu lassen, die sich zuvor auf der Internetseite des Unternehmens aufgehalten haben. Die Integration von Google Remarketing gestattet es einem Unternehmen demnach, nutzerbezogene Werbung zu erstellen und dem Internetnutzer folglich interessenrelevante Werbeanzeigen anzeigen zu lassen.

Betreibergesellschaft der Dienste von Google Remarketing ist die Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Zweck von Google Remarketing ist die Einblendung von interessenrelevanter Werbung. Google Remarketing ermöglicht es uns, Werbeanzeigen über das Google-Werbenetzwerk anzuzeigen oder auf anderen Internetseiten anzeigen zu lassen, welche auf die individuellen Bedürfnisse und Interessen von Internetnutzern abgestimmt sind.

Google Remarketing setzt ein Cookie auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person. Was Cookies sind, wurde oben bereits erläutert. Mit der Setzung des Cookies wird Google eine Wiedererkennung des Besuchers unserer Internetseite ermöglicht, wenn dieser in der Folge Internetseiten aufruft, die ebenfalls Mitglied des Google-Werbenetzwerks sind. Mit jedem Aufruf einer Internetseite, auf welcher der Dienst von Google Remarketing integriert wurde, identifiziert sich der Internetbrowser der betroffenen Person automatisch bei Google. Im Rahmen dieses technischen Verfahrens erhält Google Kenntnis über personenbezogene Daten, wie der IP-Adresse oder des Surfverhaltens des Nutzers, welche Google unter anderem zur Einblendung interessenrelevanter Werbung verwendet.

Mittels des Cookies werden personenbezogene Informationen, beispielsweise die durch die betroffene Person besuchten Internetseiten, gespeichert. Bei jedem Besuch unserer Internetseiten werden demnach personenbezogene Daten, einschließlich der IP-Adresse des von der betroffenen Person genutzten Internetanschlusses, an Google in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika übertragen. Diese personenbezogenen Daten werden durch Google in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika gespeichert. Google gibt diese über das technische Verfahren erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten unter Umständen an Dritte weiter.

Die betroffene Person kann die Setzung von Cookies durch unsere Internetseite, wie oben bereits dargestellt, jederzeit mittels einer entsprechenden Einstellung des genutzten Internetbrowsers verhindern und damit der Setzung von Cookies dauerhaft widersprechen. Eine solche Einstellung des genutzten Internetbrowsers würde auch verhindern, dass Google ein Cookie auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person setzt. Zudem kann ein von Google Analytics bereits gesetzter Cookie jederzeit über den Internetbrowser oder andere Softwareprogramme gelöscht werden.

Ferner besteht für die betroffene Person die Möglichkeit, der interessenbezogenen Werbung durch Google zu widersprechen. Hierzu muss die betroffene Person von jedem der von ihr genutzten Internetbrowser aus den Link www.google.de/settings/ads aufrufen und dort die gewünschten Einstellungen vornehmen.
Weitere Informationen und die geltenden Datenschutzbestimmungen von Google können unter https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ abgerufen werden.

####  18. Datenschutzbestimmungen zu Einsatz und Verwendung von Google-AdWords

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche hat auf dieser Internetseite Google AdWords integriert. Google AdWords ist ein Dienst zur Internetwerbung, der es Werbetreibenden gestattet, sowohl Anzeigen in den Suchmaschinenergebnissen von Google als auch im Google-Werbenetzwerk zu schalten. Google AdWords ermöglicht es einem Werbetreibenden, vorab bestimmte Schlüsselwörter festzulegen, mittels derer eine Anzeige in den Suchmaschinenergebnissen von Google ausschließlich dann angezeigt wird, wenn der Nutzer mit der Suchmaschine ein schlüsselwortrelevantes Suchergebnis abruft. Im Google-Werbenetzwerk werden die Anzeigen mittels eines automatischen Algorithmus und unter Beachtung der zuvor festgelegten Schlüsselwörter auf themenrelevanten Internetseiten verteilt.

Betreibergesellschaft der Dienste von Google AdWords ist die Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Der Zweck von Google AdWords ist die Bewerbung unserer Internetseite durch die Einblendung von interessenrelevanter Werbung auf den Internetseiten von Drittunternehmen und in den Suchmaschinenergebnissen der Suchmaschine Google und eine Einblendung von Fremdwerbung auf unserer Internetseite.

Gelangt eine betroffene Person über eine Google-Anzeige auf unsere Internetseite, wird auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person durch Google ein sogenannter Conversion-Cookie abgelegt. Was Cookies sind, wurde oben bereits erläutert. Ein Conversion-Cookie verliert nach dreißig Tagen seine Gültigkeit und dient nicht zur Identifikation der betroffenen Person. Über den Conversion-Cookie wird, sofern das Cookie noch nicht abgelaufen ist, nachvollzogen, ob bestimmte Unterseiten, beispielsweise der Warenkorb von einem Online-Shop-System, auf unserer Internetseite aufgerufen wurden. Durch den Conversion-Cookie können sowohl wir als auch Google nachvollziehen, ob eine betroffene Person, die über eine AdWords-Anzeige auf unsere Internetseite gelangt ist, einen Umsatz generierte, also einen Warenkauf vollzogen oder abgebrochen hat.

Die durch die Nutzung des Conversion-Cookies erhobenen Daten und Informationen werden von Google verwendet, um Besuchsstatistiken für unsere Internetseite zu erstellen. Diese Besuchsstatistiken werden durch uns wiederum genutzt, um die Gesamtanzahl der Nutzer zu ermitteln, welche über AdWords-Anzeigen an uns vermittelt wurden, also um den Erfolg oder Misserfolg der jeweiligen AdWords-Anzeige zu ermitteln und um unsere AdWords-Anzeigen für die Zukunft zu optimieren. Weder unser Unternehmen noch andere Werbekunden von Google-AdWords erhalten Informationen von Google, mittels derer die betroffene Person identifiziert werden könnte.

Mittels des Conversion-Cookies werden personenbezogene Informationen, beispielsweise die durch die betroffene Person besuchten Internetseiten, gespeichert. Bei jedem Besuch unserer Internetseiten werden demnach personenbezogene Daten, einschließlich der IP-Adresse des von der betroffenen Person genutzten Internetanschlusses, an Google in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika übertragen. Diese personenbezogenen Daten werden durch Google in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika gespeichert. Google gibt diese über das technische Verfahren erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten unter Umständen an Dritte weiter.

Die betroffene Person kann die Setzung von Cookies durch unsere Internetseite, wie oben bereits dargestellt, jederzeit mittels einer entsprechenden Einstellung des genutzten Internetbrowsers verhindern und damit der Setzung von Cookies dauerhaft widersprechen. Eine solche Einstellung des genutzten Internetbrowsers würde auch verhindern, dass Google einen Conversion-Cookie auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person setzt. Zudem kann ein von Google AdWords bereits gesetzter Cookie jederzeit über den Internetbrowser oder andere Softwareprogramme gelöscht werden.
Ferner besteht für die betroffene Person die Möglichkeit, der interessenbezogenen Werbung durch Google zu widersprechen. Hierzu muss die betroffene Person von jedem der von ihr genutzten Internetbrowser aus den Link www.google.de/settings/ads aufrufen und dort die gewünschten Einstellungen vornehmen.

Weitere Informationen und die geltenden Datenschutzbestimmungen von Google können unter https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ abgerufen werden.

####  19. Datenschutzbestimmungen zu Einsatz und Verwendung von Twitter

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche hat auf dieser Internetseite Komponenten von Twitter integriert. Twitter ist ein multilingualer öffentlich zugänglicher Mikroblogging-Dienst, auf welchem die Nutzer sogenannte Tweets, also Kurznachrichten, die auf 280 Zeichen begrenzt sind, veröffentlichen und verbreiten können. Diese Kurznachrichten sind für jedermann, also auch für nicht bei Twitter angemeldete Personen abrufbar. Die Tweets werden aber auch den sogenannten Followern des jeweiligen Nutzers angezeigt. Follower sind andere Twitter-Nutzer, die den Tweets eines Nutzers folgen. Ferner ermöglicht Twitter über Hashtags, Verlinkungen oder Retweets die Ansprache eines breiten Publikums.

Betreibergesellschaft von Twitter ist die Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.

Durch jeden Aufruf einer der Einzelseiten dieser Internetseite, die durch den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen betrieben wird und auf welcher eine Twitter-Komponente (Twitter-Button) integriert wurde, wird der Internetbrowser auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person automatisch durch die jeweilige Twitter-Komponente veranlasst, eine Darstellung der entsprechenden Twitter-Komponente von Twitter herunterzuladen. Weitere Informationen zu den Twitter-Buttons sind unter https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons abrufbar. Im Rahmen dieses technischen Verfahrens erhält Twitter Kenntnis darüber, welche konkrete Unterseite unserer Internetseite durch die betroffene Person besucht wird. Zweck der Integration der Twitter-Komponente ist es, unseren Nutzern eine Weiterverbreitung der Inhalte diese Internetseite zu ermöglichen, diese Internetseite in der digitalen Welt bekannt zu machen und unsere Besucherzahlen zu erhöhen.

Sofern die betroffene Person gleichzeitig bei Twitter eingeloggt ist, erkennt Twitter mit jedem Aufruf unserer Internetseite durch die betroffene Person und während der gesamten Dauer des jeweiligen Aufenthaltes auf unserer Internetseite, welche konkrete Unterseite unserer Internetseite die betroffene Person besucht. Diese Informationen werden durch die Twitter-Komponente gesammelt und durch Twitter dem jeweiligen Twitter-Account der betroffenen Person zugeordnet. Betätigt die betroffene Person einen der auf unserer Internetseite integrierten Twitter-Buttons, werden die damit übertragenen Daten und Informationen dem persönlichen Twitter-Benutzerkonto der betroffenen Person zugeordnet und von Twitter gespeichert und verarbeitet.

Twitter erhält über die Twitter-Komponente immer dann eine Information darüber, dass die betroffene Person unsere Internetseite besucht hat, wenn die betroffene Person zum Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs unserer Internetseite gleichzeitig bei Twitter eingeloggt ist; dies findet unabhängig davon statt, ob die betroffene Person die Twitter-Komponente anklickt oder nicht. Ist eine derartige Übermittlung dieser Informationen an Twitter von der betroffenen Person nicht gewollt, kann diese die Übermittlung dadurch verhindern, dass sie sich vor einem Aufruf unserer Internetseite aus ihrem Twitter-Account ausloggt.

Die geltenden Datenschutzbestimmungen von Twitter sind unter https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=de abrufbar.

####  20. Datenschutzbestimmungen zu Einsatz und Verwendung von YouTube

Der für die Verarbeitung Verantwortliche hat auf dieser Internetseite Komponenten von YouTube integriert. YouTube ist ein Internet-Videoportal, dass Video-Publishern das kostenlose Einstellen von Videoclips und anderen Nutzern die ebenfalls kostenfreie Betrachtung, Bewertung und Kommentierung dieser ermöglicht. YouTube gestattet die Publikation aller Arten von Videos, weshalb sowohl komplette Film- und Fernsehsendungen, aber auch Musikvideos, Trailer oder von Nutzern selbst angefertigte Videos über das Internetportal abrufbar sind.

Betreibergesellschaft von YouTube ist die YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. Die YouTube, LLC ist einer Tochtergesellschaft der Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Durch jeden Aufruf einer der Einzelseiten dieser Internetseite, die durch den für die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen betrieben wird und auf welcher eine YouTube-Komponente (YouTube-Video) integriert wurde, wird der Internetbrowser auf dem informationstechnologischen System der betroffenen Person automatisch durch die jeweilige YouTube-Komponente veranlasst, eine Darstellung der entsprechenden YouTube-Komponente von YouTube herunterzuladen. Weitere Informationen zu YouTube können unter https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/ abgerufen werden. Im Rahmen dieses technischen Verfahrens erhalten YouTube und Google Kenntnis darüber, welche konkrete Unterseite unserer Internetseite durch die betroffene Person besucht wird.

Sofern die betroffene Person gleichzeitig bei YouTube eingeloggt ist, erkennt YouTube mit dem Aufruf einer Unterseite, die ein YouTube-Video enthält, welche konkrete Unterseite unserer Internetseite die betroffene Person besucht. Diese Informationen werden durch YouTube und Google gesammelt und dem jeweiligen YouTube-Account der betroffenen Person zugeordnet.

YouTube und Google erhalten über die YouTube-Komponente immer dann eine Information darüber, dass die betroffene Person unsere Internetseite besucht hat, wenn die betroffene Person zum Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs unserer Internetseite gleichzeitig bei YouTube eingeloggt ist; dies findet unabhängig davon statt, ob die betroffene Person ein YouTube-Video anklickt oder nicht. Ist eine derartige Übermittlung dieser Informationen an YouTube und Google von der betroffenen Person nicht gewollt, kann diese die Übermittlung dadurch verhindern, dass sie sich vor einem Aufruf unserer Internetseite aus ihrem YouTube-Account ausloggt.

Die von YouTube veröffentlichten Datenschutzbestimmungen, die unter https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ abrufbar sind, geben Aufschluss über die Erhebung, Verarbeitung und Nutzung personenbezogener Daten durch YouTube und Google.

####  21. Zahlungsart: Datenschutzbestimmungen zu Payone als Zahlungsart Kreditkarte

Mit der Auswahl der Zahlungsoption Kreditkarte willigt die betroffene Person in die zur Zahlungsabwicklung erforderliche Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten an Payone ein. Die Rechtsgrundlage für die Übermittlung der Daten ist Artikel 6 (1) a DSGVO (Einwilligung) und Artikel 6 (1) b DSGVO (Verarbeitung zur Erfüllung eines Vertrags) von PAYONE GmbH, Lyoner Straße 9, 60528 Frankfurt am Main, Deutschland. E-Mail: privacy@payone.com

Mit der Kreditkartenzahlung willigen Sie in die Übermittlung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, wie Name, E-Mail-Adresse und Kreditkartendaten, an Payone ein. Welche weiteren Daten von Payone erhoben werden, entnehmen Sie bitte deren Datenschutzbestimmungen:
https://docs.payone.com/display/public/PLATFORM/Privacy+Policy

####  22. Rechtsgrundlage der Verarbeitung

Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO dient unserem Unternehmen als Rechtsgrundlage für Verarbeitungsvorgänge, bei denen wir eine Einwilligung für einen bestimmten Verarbeitungszweck einholen. Ist die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten zur Erfüllung eines Vertrags, dessen Vertragspartei die betroffene Person ist, erforderlich, wie dies beispielsweise bei Verarbeitungsvorgängen der Fall ist, die für eine Lieferung von Waren oder die Erbringung einer sonstigen Leistung oder Gegenleistung notwendig sind, so beruht die Verarbeitung auf Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GVO. Gleiches gilt für solche Verarbeitungsvorgänge die zur Durchführung vorvertraglicher Maßnahmen erforderlich sind, etwa in Fällen von Anfragen zur unseren Produkten oder Leistungen. Unterliegt unser Unternehmen einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung durch welche eine Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten erforderlich wird, wie beispielsweise zur Erfüllung steuerlicher Pflichten, so basiert die Verarbeitung auf Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GVO. In seltenen Fällen könnte die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten erforderlich werden, um lebenswichtige Interessen der betroffenen Person oder einer anderen natürlichen Person zu schützen. Dies wäre beispielsweise der Fall, wenn ein Besucher in unserem Betrieb verletzt werden würde und daraufhin sein Name, sein Alter, seine Krankenkassendaten oder sonstige lebenswichtige Informationen an einen Arzt, ein Krankenhaus oder sonstige Dritte weitergegeben werden müssten. Dann würde die Verarbeitung auf Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GVO beruhen. Letztlich könnten Verarbeitungsvorgänge auf Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GVO beruhen.

Auf dieser Rechtsgrundlage basieren Verarbeitungsvorgänge, die von keiner der vorgenannten Rechtsgrundlagen erfasst werden, wenn die Verarbeitung zur Wahrung eines berechtigten Interesses unseres Unternehmens oder eines Dritten erforderlich ist, sofern die Interessen, Grundrechte und Grundfreiheiten des Betroffenen nicht überwiegen. Solche Verarbeitungsvorgänge sind uns insbesondere deshalb gestattet, weil sie durch den Europäischen Gesetzgeber besonders erwähnt wurden. Er vertrat insoweit die Auffassung, dass ein berechtigtes Interesse anzunehmen sein könnte, wenn die betroffene Person ein Kunde des Verantwortlichen ist (Erwägungsgrund 47 Satz 2 DS-GVO).

####  23. Berechtigte Interessen an der Verarbeitung, die von dem Verantwortlichen oder einem Dritten verfolgt werden

Basiert die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten auf Artikel 6 I lit. f DS-GVO ist unser berechtigtes Interesse die Durchführung unserer Geschäftstätigkeit zugunsten des Wohlergehens all unserer Mitarbeiter und unserer Anteilseigner.

####  24. Dauer, für die die personenbezogenen Daten gespeichert werden

Das Kriterium für die Dauer der Speicherung von personenbezogenen Daten ist die jeweilige gesetzliche Aufbewahrungsfrist. Nach Ablauf der Frist werden die entsprechenden Daten routinemäßig gelöscht, sofern sie nicht mehr zur Vertragserfüllung oder Vertragsanbahnung erforderlich sind.

####  25. Gesetzliche oder vertragliche Vorschriften zur Bereitstellung der personenbezogenen Daten; Erforderlichkeit für den Vertragsabschluss; Verpflichtung der betroffenen Person, die personenbezogenen Daten bereitzustellen; mögliche Folgen der Nichtbereitstellung

Wir klären Sie darüber auf, dass die Bereitstellung personenbezogener Daten zum Teil gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist (z.B. Steuervorschriften) oder sich auch aus vertraglichen Regelungen (z.B. Angaben zum Vertragspartner) ergeben kann. Mitunter kann es zu einem Vertragsschluss erforderlich sein, dass eine betroffene Person uns personenbezogene Daten zur Verfügung stellt, die in der Folge durch uns verarbeitet werden müssen. Die betroffene Person ist beispielsweise verpflichtet uns personenbezogene Daten bereitzustellen, wenn unser Unternehmen mit ihr einen Vertrag abschließt. Eine Nichtbereitstellung der personenbezogenen Daten hätte zur Folge, dass der Vertrag mit dem Betroffenen nicht geschlossen werden könnte. Vor einer Bereitstellung personenbezogener Daten durch den Betroffenen muss sich der Betroffene an einen unserer Mitarbeiter wenden. Unser Mitarbeiter klärt den Betroffenen einzelfallbezogen darüber auf, ob die Bereitstellung der personenbezogenen Daten gesetzlich oder vertraglich vorgeschrieben oder für den Vertragsabschluss erforderlich ist, ob eine Verpflichtung besteht, die personenbezogenen Daten bereitzustellen, und welche Folgen die Nichtbereitstellung der personenbezogenen Daten hätte.

####  26. Auftragsverarbeiter

Wir bedienen uns externen Dienstleistern (Auftragsverarbeitern) z. B. für den Versand von Newslettern, Zahlungsabwicklungen per Kreditkarte oder Reiseprogrammen. Mit dem Dienstleister wurde eine separate Auftragsdatenverarbeitung geschlossen, um den Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu gewährleisten.

Sollten Sie Einsicht wünschen um zu wissen, mit welchen Dienstleistern wir zusammenarbeiten, können Sie eine Liste bei uns anfordern. Schreiben Sie uns hierzu eine E-Mail an datenschutz@venturatravel.org und wir schicken Ihnen die gewünschten Informationen zu.

####  27. Haftungsausschluss

Trotz sorgfältiger inhaltlicher Kontrolle übernehmen wir für alle externen Links auf unserer Internetseite keine Haftung. Zum Zeitpunkt der Verlinkung waren keine illegalen Inhalte auf den externen Seiten erkennbar. Da wir auf die gegenwärtige und zukünftige Gestaltung fremder Seiten jedoch keinen Einfluss haben distanzieren wir uns hiermit ausdrücklich von deren Inhalten.

####  28. Bestehen einer automatisierten Entscheidungsfindung

Als verantwortungsbewusstes Unternehmen verzichten wir auf eine automatische Entscheidungsfindung oder ein Profiling.

Diese Datenschutzerklärung wurde durch den Datenschutzerklärungs-Generator der DGD Deutsche Gesellschaft für Datenschutz GmbH, die als Externer Datenschutzbeauftragter Dachau tätig ist, in Kooperation mit dem Anwalt für Datenschutzrecht Christian Solmecke erstellt.

La déclaration concerne la collecte, le traitement et l'utilisation de vos données personnelles. Les données personnelles comprennent votre nom, votre adresse postale, votre e-mail et votre adresse IP, ainsi que les données d'utilisation qui vous sont attribuables, etc.

Le traitement des données personnelles, telles que le nom, l'adresse, l'adresse électronique ou le numéro de téléphone d'une personne concernée, doit toujours être conforme aux règles de protection des données spécifiques au pays et applicables à la Ventura TRAVEL GmbH. Par le biais de cette déclaration de protection des données, notre entreprise souhaite informer le public sur la nature, la portée et la finalité des données personnelles que nous collectons, utilisons et traitons. En outre, les personnes concernées sont informées de leurs droits au moyen de la présente déclaration de protection des données.

En tant que responsable du traitement, la société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH a mis en œuvre de nombreuses mesures techniques et organisationnelles pour assurer la protection la plus complète des données personnelles traitées par le biais de ce site web. Cependant, les transferts de données par Internet peuvent toujours être sujets à des failles de sécurité, de sorte qu'une protection absolue ne peut être garantie. Pour cette raison, chaque personne concernée est libre de nous transmettre des données personnelles par d'autres moyens, par exemple par téléphone.

####  1. Définitions des termes

La déclaration de protection des données de la société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH se fonde sur les termes utilisés par la directive européenne et l'ordonnance du fabricant lors de la publication du règlement sur la protection des données (RGPD). Notre déclaration de protection des données doit être facile à lire et à comprendre pour le public ainsi que pour nos clients et partenaires commerciaux. Pour ce faire, nous souhaitons expliquer au préalable les termes utilisés.

Nous utilisons les termes suivants, entre autres, dans la présente déclaration de protection des données :

####  (a) Les données personnelles
Par données à caractère personnel, on entend toute information relative à une personne physique identifiée ou identifiable (ci-après "personne concernée"). Une personne physique identifiable est une personne qui peut être identifiée, directement ou indirectement, notamment par référence à un identifiant tel qu'un nom, un numéro d'identification, des données de localisation, un identifiant en ligne ou à un ou plusieurs facteurs spécifiques à l'identité physique, physiologique, génétique, mentale, économique, culturelle ou sociale de cette personne physique.

####  (b) Personne concernée
Personne concernée : toute personne physique identifiée ou identifiable dont les données personnelles sont traitées par le responsable du traitement.

####  (c\\) La transformation
Traitement : toute opération ou ensemble d'opérations effectuées ou non à l'aide de procédés automatisés et appliquées à des données à caractère personnel, telles que la collecte, l'enregistrement, l'organisation, le classement, la conservation, l'adaptation ou la modification, l'extraction, la consultation, l'utilisation, la communication par transmission, la diffusion ou toute autre forme de mise à disposition, le rapprochement ou l'interconnexion, la limitation, l'effacement ou la destruction.

####  (d) Restriction du traitement
La restriction du traitement est le marquage des données personnelles stockées dans le but de limiter leur traitement futur.

####  (e) Le profilage
Le profilage est tout type de traitement automatisé de données à caractère personnel consistant à utiliser ces données pour évaluer certains aspects personnels relatifs à une personne physique, notamment pour analyser ou prédire des aspects correspondant au rendement au travail, à la situation économique, à la santé, aux préférences personnelles, aux intérêts, à la fiabilité, au comportement, à la localisation ou au changement de localisation de cette personne physique.

####  (f) Pseudonymisation
La pseudonymisation est le traitement de données à caractère personnel de telle sorte que les données à caractère personnel ne puissent plus être attribuées à une personne concernée spécifique sans utiliser d'informations supplémentaires, à condition que ces informations supplémentaires soient conservées individuellement. En outre, elles doivent faire l'objet de mesures techniques et organisationnelles garantissant que les données à caractère personnel ne sont pas attribuées à une personne physique identifiée ou identifiable.

####  (g) Contrôleur ou responsable du traitement des données
Le responsable ou le responsable du traitement est la personne physique ou morale, l'autorité publique, le service ou un autre organisme qui, seul ou conjointement avec d'autres acteurs, détermine les finalités et les moyens du traitement des données à caractère personnel. Lorsque les finalités et les moyens de ce traitement sont déterminés par le droit de l'Union ou des États membres, le responsable du traitement ou les critères spécifiques de sa désignation peuvent être prévus par le droit de l'Union ou des États membres.

####  (h) Processeur
Le sous-traitant est une personne physique ou morale, une autorité publique, un service ou un autre organisme qui traite des données à caractère personnel pour le compte du responsable du traitement.

####  (i) Bénéficiaire
Le destinataire est une personne physique ou morale, une autorité publique, une agence ou un autre organisme à qui des données à caractère personnel sont divulguées, qu'il s'agisse ou non d'une tierce partie. Toutefois, les autorités publiques qui peuvent recevoir des données à caractère personnel dans le cadre d'une mission d'enquête spécifique en vertu du droit de l'Union ou des États membres ne sont pas considérées comme des destinataires.

####  j) Tierce partie
Tierce partie est toute personne physique ou morale, autorité publique, agence ou autre organisme autre que la personne concernée, le responsable du traitement, le sous-traitant et les personnes qui, sous l'autorité directe du responsable du traitement ou du sous-traitant, sont autorisées à traiter les données à caractère personnel.

####  k) Consentement
On entend par consentement toute indication spécifique et informée, donnée librement, sous la forme d'une déclaration ou d'un autre acte positif non équivoque, par laquelle la personne concernée accepte que des données à caractère personnel la concernant soient traitées.

####  2. Le nom et l'adresse du responsable du traitement des données

Le responsable du traitement au sens du règlement général sur la protection des données, des autres lois sur la protection des données applicables dans les États membres de l'Union européenne et des autres dispositions de nature à protéger les données est :
Ventura TRAVEL GmbH

####  4. Cookies et autres technologies de suivi

Le site web de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH utilise des cookies et d'autres technologies de suivi (comme le stockage local HTML5). Les cookies sont des fichiers texte qui sont stockés sur un système informatique via un navigateur Internet.

De nombreux sites web et serveurs utilisent des cookies contenant chacun un "cookie ID". L'ID d'un cookie est un identifiant unique. Il s'agit d'une chaîne de caractères permettant d'attribuer des pages Internet et des serveurs au navigateur Internet spécifique dans lequel le cookie a été stocké. Cela permet aux pages Internet visitées et aux serveurs de distinguer le navigateur individuel de la personne concernée des autres navigateurs Internet qui contiennent d'autres cookies. Un navigateur Internet spécifique peut être reconnu et identifié grâce à l'ID unique du cookie.

Grâce à l'utilisation de cookies, la société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH peut fournir aux utilisateurs de ce site web des services plus conviviaux qui ne seraient pas possibles sans le paramétrage du cookie.

Grâce à un cookie, les informations et les offres de notre site web peuvent être optimisées pour l'utilisateur. Les cookies nous permettent, comme déjà mentionné, de reconnaître les utilisateurs de notre site web. Le but de cette reconnaissance est de faciliter l'utilisation de notre site web par les utilisateurs. Par exemple, l'utilisateur d'un site web qui utilise des cookies ne doit pas saisir à nouveau ses données d'accès à chaque fois qu'il visite le site web, car cette opération est effectuée par le site web et le cookie stocké sur le système informatique de l'utilisateur. Un autre exemple est le cookie d'un panier d'achat dans une boutique en ligne. Cette dernière garde en mémoire les articles qu'un client a placés dans son panier virtuel grâce à un cookie.

La personne concernée peut empêcher à tout moment la mise en place de cookies par notre site Internet au moyen d'un réglage approprié du navigateur Internet utilisé. Il pourra ainsi s'opposer de manière permanente à la mise en place de cookies. En outre, les cookies qui ont déjà été installés peuvent être supprimés à tout moment par le biais d'un navigateur Internet ou d'autres logiciels. Cela est possible dans tous les navigateurs Internet courants. Si la personne concernée désactive le paramétrage des cookies dans le navigateur Internet utilisé, il se peut que toutes les fonctions de notre site Internet ne soient pas entièrement utilisables.

####  5. Collecte de données et d'informations générales

Le site web de la société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH recueille une série de données et d'informations générales chaque fois qu'une personne concernée ou un système automatisé appelle le site web. Ces données et informations générales sont stockées dans les fichiers journaux du serveur. Les données suivantes peuvent être collectées : (1) les types et versions de navigateur utilisés, (2) le système d'exploitation utilisé par le système d'accès, (3) le site web à partir duquel un système d'accès accède à notre site web (appelé référent), (4) les sous-sites web auxquels un système d'accès accède sur notre site web, (5) la date et l'heure d'un accès au site web, (6) une adresse de protocole Internet (adresse IP), (7) le fournisseur d'accès Internet du système d'accès et (8) d'autres données et informations similaires qui servent à éviter tout danger en cas d'attaque de nos systèmes informatiques.

En utilisant ces données et informations générales, la société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH ne tire aucune conclusion sur la personne concernée. Ces informations sont plutôt nécessaires (1) pour livrer correctement le contenu de notre site web, (2) pour optimiser le contenu de notre site web et la publicité pour celui-ci, (3) pour assurer la fonctionnalité à long terme de nos systèmes informatiques et de la technologie de notre site web, et (4) pour fournir aux autorités chargées de l'application de la loi les informations nécessaires à la poursuite en cas de cyberattaque. C'est pourquoi la société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH analyse d'une part les données et informations collectées de manière anonyme, et d'autre part, dans le but d'accroître la protection et la sécurité des données de notre entreprise, d'assurer un niveau optimal de protection des données personnelles que nous traitons. Les données anonymes des fichiers journaux du serveur sont stockées séparément de toute donnée personnelle soumise par une personne concernée.

####  6. Inscription sur notre site web

La personne concernée a la possibilité de s'inscrire sur le site web du responsable du traitement en fournissant des données personnelles. Les données personnelles qui sont transmises au responsable du traitement dans le processus résultent du masque de saisie respectif utilisé pour l'enregistrement. Les données personnelles saisies par la personne concernée sont collectées et stockées exclusivement pour un usage interne au responsable du traitement et pour ses propres besoins. Le responsable du traitement peut faire en sorte que les données soient transférées à un ou plusieurs sous-traitants, par exemple un fournisseur de services de colis, qui utiliseront également les données personnelles exclusivement pour un usage interne imputable au responsable du traitement.

Lors de l'inscription sur le site web du responsable du traitement, l'adresse IP attribuée par le fournisseur de services Internet (FSI) de la personne concernée, la date ainsi que l'heure de l'inscription sont en outre stockées. Le stockage de ces données a lieu dans la mesure où ce n'est qu'ainsi que l'on peut prévenir l'utilisation abusive de nos services et, si nécessaire, ces données permettent d'élucider les infractions pénales qui ont été commises. À cet égard, le stockage de ces données est nécessaire pour la protection du responsable du traitement. Par principe, ces données ne seront pas divulguées à de tierces parties, sauf s'il existe une obligation légale de les divulguer ou si la divulgation sert à des fins de poursuites pénales.

L'enregistrement de la personne concernée par la fourniture volontaire de données personnelles sert au responsable du traitement à offrir à la personne concernée des contenus ou des services qui, en raison de la nature de la question, ne peuvent être offerts qu'aux utilisateurs enregistrés. Les personnes enregistrées sont libres de modifier à tout moment les données personnelles fournies lors de l'enregistrement, ou de les faire supprimer complètement de la base de données du responsable du traitement.

Le responsable du traitement fournit à toute personne concernée, à tout moment et sur demande, des informations sur les données à caractère personnel stockées concernant la personne concernée. En outre, le responsable du traitement rectifie ou efface les données à caractère personnel à la demande ou sur indication de la personne concernée, à condition que cela ne soit pas contraire aux obligations légales de conservation. Dans ce contexte, l'ensemble du personnel du responsable du traitement est à la disposition de la personne concernée en tant que personnes de contact.

####  7. L'inscription à notre newsletter

Sur le site web de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH, les utilisateurs ont la possibilité de s'abonner à la lettre d'information de notre entreprise. Les données personnelles transmises au responsable du traitement lors de l'inscription à notre newsletter seront spécifiées dans le masque de saisie utilisé à cette fin.

La société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH informe régulièrement ses clients et partenaires commerciaux des offres de l'entreprise par le biais d'une newsletter. En général, la personne concernée ne peut recevoir la lettre d'information de notre entreprise que si (1) la personne concernée dispose d'une adresse électronique valide et (2) la personne concernée s'inscrit pour recevoir la lettre d'information. Pour des raisons juridiques, un e-mail de confirmation sera envoyé à l'adresse e-mail saisie par une personne concernée pour la première fois pour l'envoi de la newsletter selon la procédure du double opt-in. Cet e-mail de confirmation sert à vérifier si le propriétaire de l'adresse e-mail en tant que personne concernée a autorisé la réception de la newsletter.

Lors de l'inscription à la newsletter, nous stockons également l'adresse IP du système informatique utilisé par la personne concernée au moment de l'inscription, telle qu'attribuée par le fournisseur d'accès à Internet (FAI), ainsi que la date et l'heure de l'inscription. La collecte de ces données est nécessaire pour pouvoir retracer l'utilisation (éventuellement) abusive de l'adresse électronique d'une personne concernée à un moment ultérieur et sert donc la protection juridique du responsable du traitement.

Les données personnelles collectées dans le cadre d'une inscription à la newsletter sont exclusivement utilisées pour l'envoi de notre newsletter. En outre, les abonnés à la lettre d'information pourraient être informés par courrier électronique si cela est nécessaire au fonctionnement du service de la lettre d'information ou à un enregistrement connexe, comme cela pourrait être le cas en cas de modification de l'offre de la lettre d'information ou de changements dans les circonstances techniques. Aucune donnée personnelle collectée dans le cadre du service de la newsletter ne sera transmise à de tierces parties. L'abonnement à notre newsletter peut être annulé par la personne concernée à tout moment. Le consentement au stockage des données personnelles, que la personne concernée nous a donné pour l'envoi de la newsletter, peut être révoqué à tout moment. Pour la révocation du consentement, un lien correspondant se trouve dans chaque bulletin d'information. En outre, il est également possible de se désinscrire à tout moment de l'envoi de la newsletter directement sur le site web du responsable du traitement ou d'en informer le responsable du traitement d'une autre manière.

####  8. Suivi des newsletters

Les newsletters de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH contiennent des pixels de suivi. Un pixel de suivi est un graphique miniature qui est intégré dans les courriers électroniques envoyés au format HTML pour permettre l'enregistrement et l'analyse des fichiers journaux. Cela permet une évaluation statistique du succès ou de l'échec des campagnes de marketing en ligne. Sur la base du pixel de suivi intégré, la Ventura TRAVEL GmbH peut voir si et quand un e-mail a été ouvert par une personne concernée, et quels liens dans l'e-mail ont été appelés par la personne concernée.

Ces données personnelles collectées via le pixel de suivi contenu dans les newsletters sont stockées et analysées par le responsable du traitement afin d'optimiser l'envoi de la newsletter et de mieux adapter le contenu des futures newsletters dans l’intérêt de la personne concernée. Ces données personnelles ne seront pas divulguées à de tierces parties. Les personnes concernées ont le droit de révoquer à tout moment la déclaration de consentement distincte correspondante donnée via la procédure de double opt-in. Après une révocation, ces données personnelles seront supprimées par le responsable du traitement des données. La société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH considère automatiquement le retrait de la réception de la newsletter comme une révocation.

####  9. Possibilité de contact via le site web

Sur la base des dispositions légales, le site web de la société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH contient des informations permettant un contact électronique rapide avec notre entreprise, ainsi qu'une communication directe avec nous, ce qui inclut également une adresse générale du courrier électronique (adresse e-mail). Si une personne concernée contacte le responsable du traitement par courrier électronique, en utilisant un formulaire de contact, ou en utilisant une fonction de chat, les données personnelles transmises par la personne concernée seront stockées automatiquement. Ces données personnelles transmises sur une base volontaire par une personne concernée au responsable du traitement seront stockées aux fins du traitement ou de la prise de contact avec la personne concernée. Ces données personnelles ne seront pas divulguées à de tierces parties.

####  10. Fonction de commentaire dans le blog sur la page Internet

La société Ventura TRAVEL GmbH offre aux utilisateurs la possibilité de laisser des commentaires individuels sur des contributions individuelles à un blog, qui se trouve sur le site web du contrôleur. Un blog est un portail, généralement accessible au public, maintenu sur un site web, dans lequel une ou plusieurs personnes, appelées blogueurs ou blogueurs web, peuvent publier des articles ou écrire des pensées dans des billets de blog. Les articles du blog peuvent généralement être commentés par de tierces parties.

Si une personne concernée laisse un commentaire sur le blog publié sur ce site web, outre les commentaires laissés par la personne concernée, des informations sur l'heure de saisie du commentaire et le nom d'utilisateur (pseudonyme) choisi par la personne concernée seront stockées et publiées. En outre, l'adresse IP attribuée par le fournisseur d'accès à Internet (FAI) de la personne concernée est également enregistrée. Ce stockage de l'adresse IP est effectué pour des raisons de sécurité, notamment dans le cas où la personne concernée violerait les droits de tierces parties en publiant un commentaire ou en diffusant un contenu illégal. La conservation de ces données personnelles est donc dans l'intérêt du responsable du traitement, afin que celui-ci puisse se disculper si nécessaire en cas d'infraction. Aucune divulgation de ces données personnelles collectées à de tierces parties n'aura lieu, à moins qu'une telle divulgation ne soit requise par la loi ou ne serve à la défense juridique du responsable du traitement.

####  11. Abonnement aux commentaires dans le blog du site web

Les commentaires publiés dans le blog de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH peuvent généralement être souscrits par de tierces parties. En effet, un commentateur peut s'abonner aux autres commentaires donnant suite au sien sur un certain article de blog.

Si une personne concernée opte pour l'option d'abonnement aux commentaires, le responsable du traitement enverra un e-mail de confirmation automatique afin de vérifier, au moyen d'une procédure de double opt-in, que le propriétaire de l'adresse e-mail indiquée a bien opté pour cette option. L'option d'abonnement aux commentaires peut être résiliée à tout moment.

Un autre intérêt légitime dans ce sens est, par exemple, l'obligation de fournir des preuves dans le cadre d'une procédure en vertu de la loi générale sur l'égalité de traitement (AGG).

####  15. Dispositions relatives à la protection des données concernant l'utilisation et l'application de Facebook

Le contrôleur a intégré des composants de la société Facebook sur ce site web. Facebook est un réseau social.

Un réseau social est un lieu de rencontre sociale exploité sur l'internet, une communauté en ligne qui permet généralement aux utilisateurs de communiquer et d'interagir les uns avec les autres dans un espace virtuel. Un réseau social peut servir de plateforme pour le partage d'opinions et d'expériences, ou permettre à la communauté Internet de fournir des informations personnelles ou professionnelles. Facebook permet aux utilisateurs du réseau social de créer, entre autres, des profils privés, de télécharger des photos et d'établir un réseau via des demandes d'amis.

La société d'exploitation de Facebook est Facebook, Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, États-Unis. Le responsable du traitement des données personnelles, si une personne concernée vit en dehors des États-Unis ou du Canada, est Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Irlande.

À chaque appel de l'une des pages individuelles de ce site Internet, qui est exploité par le responsable du traitement et sur lequel un composant Facebook (plug-in Facebook) a été intégré, le navigateur Internet du système de technologie de l'information de la personne concernée est automatiquement amené par le composant Facebook respectif à télécharger une représentation du composant Facebook correspondant de Facebook. Vous trouverez un aperçu complet de tous les plug-ins Facebook à l'adresse https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE. Dans le cadre de cette procédure technique, Facebook reçoit des informations sur la sous-page spécifique de notre site web visitée par la personne concernée.

Si la personne concernée est connectée à Facebook en même temps, le réseau social reconnaît la sous-page spécifique de notre site web lorsqu’elle y est présente. Ces informations sont collectées par le composant Facebook et attribuées par Facebook au compte Facebook respectif de la personne concernée. Si la personne concernée active l'un des boutons Facebook intégrés sur notre site web, par exemple le bouton "J'aime", ou si la personne concernée publie un commentaire; Facebook attribue cette information au compte utilisateur Facebook personnel de la personne concernée et stocke ces données personnelles.

Facebook reçoit toujours l'information selon laquelle la personne concernée a visité notre site web, via le composant Facebook, uniquement si la personne concernée est simultanément connectée à Facebook au moment de l'appel de notre site web. Ceci a lieu indépendamment du fait que la personne concernée clique ou non sur le composant Facebook. Si la transmission de ces informations à Facebook n'est pas souhaitée par la personne concernée, elle peut l’empêcher en se déconnectant de son compte Facebook avant d’accéder à notre site web.

La politique de données publiée par Facebook, qui peut être consultée à l'adresse https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, fournit des informations sur la collecte, le traitement et l'utilisation des données personnelles par Facebook. Il explique également quelles options de réglage Facebook est proposée dans le but de protéger la vie privée de la personne concernée.

Ces applications peuvent être utilisées par la personne concernée pour supprimer la transmission de données à Facebook.

####  16. Dispositions relatives à la protection des données concernant l'utilisation et l'application de Google Analytics (avec fonction d'anonymisation)

Le responsable du traitement a intégré le composant Google Analytics (avec fonction d'anonymisation) sur ce site web. Google Analytics est un service d'analyse web. L'analyse web consiste à collecter, rassembler et évaluer des données sur le comportement des visiteurs de sites Internet. Un service d'analyse web collecte, entre autres, des données du site Internet à partir duquel une personne concernée est arrivée (appelé référent), a consulté des sous-pages. Les informations analysent quel a été le parcours de cet utilisateur sur le site Internet, à quelle fréquence les sous-pages ont été consultées, et pendant combien de temps. Une analyse web est principalement utilisée pour l'optimisation d'un site web et pour l'analyse coût-bénéfice de la publicité sur Internet.

La société exploitante du composant Google Analytics est Google Inc, 1600 Amphithéâtre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, États-Unis.

Le responsable du traitement utilise l'ajout "_gat._anonymizeIp" pour l'analyse web via Google Analytics. Grâce à cet ajout, l'adresse IP de la connexion Internet de la personne concernée est raccourcie et anonymisée par Google si l'accès à nos pages Internet a lieu depuis un État membre de l'Union européenne ou depuis un autre État partie à l'accord sur l'Espace économique européen.

L'objectif du composant Google Analytics est d'analyser le flux des visiteurs de notre site web. Google utilise les données et informations obtenues, entre autres, pour évaluer l'utilisation de notre site Web, pour compiler pour nous des rapports en ligne montrant les activités sur notre site Web et pour fournir d'autres services liés à l'utilisation de notre site Web.

Google Analytics installe un cookie sur le système informatique de la personne concernée. Pour en savoir plus sur les cookies veuillez vous référer au texte plus en haut. L'installation de ce cookie permet à Google d'analyser l'utilisation de notre site Web. À chaque appel d'une des pages individuelles de ce site Internet, qui est exploité par le responsable du traitement et sur lequel un composant Google Analytics a été intégré, le navigateur Internet du système de technologie de l'information de la personne concernée est automatiquement amené par le composant Google Analytics respectif à transmettre des données à Google à des fins d'analyse en ligne. Dans le cadre de ce processus technique, Google prend connaissance de données personnelles, telles que l'adresse IP de la personne concernée, que Google utilise, entre autres, pour suivre l'origine des visiteurs et des clics et permettre ensuite le calcul des commissions.

Au moyen du cookie, des informations personnelles sont stockées, comme l'heure d'accès, le lieu d'origine et la fréquence des visites de notre site web par la personne concernée. Chaque fois que la personne concernée visite notre site Internet, ces données personnelles, y compris l'adresse IP de la connexion Internet utilisée par la personne concernée, sont transmises à Google aux États-Unis d'Amérique. Ces données personnelles sont stockées par Google aux États-Unis d'Amérique. Google est susceptible de communiquer à des tiers les données personnelles collectées dans le cadre du processus technique.
La personne concernée peut à tout moment empêcher la mise en place de cookies par notre site Internet, comme déjà décrit ci-dessus, au moyen d'un réglage approprié du navigateur Internet utilisé et ainsi s'opposer définitivement à la mise en place de cookies. Un tel paramétrage du navigateur Internet utilisé empêcherait également Google de placer un cookie sur le système informatique de la personne concernée. En outre, un cookie déjà créé par Google Analytics peut être supprimé à tout moment via le navigateur Internet ou d'autres logiciels.

La personne concernée a aussi la possibilité de s'opposer à la collecte de données générées par Google Analytics et liées à l'utilisation de ce site web ainsi qu'au traitement de ces données par Google et d'empêcher ce traitement. Pour ce faire, la personne concernée doit télécharger et installer un module complémentaire de navigateur sous le lien https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Ce module complémentaire de navigateur informe Google Analytics via JavaScript qu'aucune donnée et information concernant la visite des pages Internet ne peut être transmise à Google Analytics. L'installation du module complémentaire du navigateur est considérée par Google comme une objection.

Si le système informatique de la personne concernée est supprimé, formaté ou réinstallé ultérieurement, la personne concernée doit réinstaller le module complémentaire du navigateur afin de désactiver Google Analytics. Si le module complémentaire de navigateur est désinstallé ou désactivé par la personne concernée ou une autre personne de sa sphère de contrôle, il existe une possibilité de réinstaller ou de réactiver le module complémentaire de navigateur.

Vous trouverez de plus amples informations ainsi que les règles de confidentialité applicables de Google sur les sites https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ et http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html. Google Analytics est expliqué plus en détail sous ce lien https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/.
####  17. Dispositions relatives à la protection des données concernant l'utilisation et l'application de Google Remarketing

Le responsable du traitement a intégré les services de Google Remarketing sur ce site web. Google Remarketing est une fonction de Google AdWords qui permet à une entreprise d'afficher des publicités aux internautes qui ont précédemment visité son site Web. L'intégration de Google Remarketing permet donc à une entreprise de créer des publicités liées à l'utilisateur et, par conséquent, d'afficher des publicités pertinentes pour l'internaute.

La société exploitant les services de Google Remarketing est Google Inc, 1600 Amphithéâtre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, États-Unis.

L'objectif de Google Remarketing est d'afficher des publicités adaptées aux centres d'intérêt. Google Remarketing nous permet d'afficher des annonces via le réseau publicitaire de Google ou de les afficher sur d'autres pages Internet, en fonction des besoins et des intérêts individuels des internautes.

Google Remarketing installe un cookie sur le système informatique de la personne concernée. Ce que sont les cookies a déjà été expliqué ci-dessus. En plaçant ce cookie, Google est en mesure de reconnaître le visiteur de notre site Web lorsqu'il visite ensuite des sites Web qui sont également membres du réseau publicitaire de Google. À chaque consultation d'un site Internet sur lequel le service Google Remarketing a été intégré, le navigateur Internet de la personne concernée s'identifie automatiquement auprès de Google. Dans le cadre de cette procédure technique, Google prend connaissance de données personnelles, telles que l'adresse IP ou le comportement de navigation de l'utilisateur, qu'il utilise notamment pour afficher des publicités pertinentes.

Au moyen du cookie, des informations personnelles sont stockées, comme les pages Internet visitées par la personne concernée par exemple. Chaque fois que la personne concernée visite notre site Internet, des données personnelles, y compris l'adresse IP de la connexion Internet utilisée par la personne concernée, sont transmises à Google aux États-Unis d'Amérique. Ces données personnelles sont stockées par Google aux États-Unis d'Amérique. Google est susceptible de communiquer à des tiers les données personnelles collectées dans le cadre du processus technique.

La personne concernée peut empêcher la mise en place de cookies par notre site Internet, comme déjà décrit ci-dessus, à tout moment au moyen d'un réglage approprié du navigateur Internet utilisé et ainsi s'opposer définitivement à la mise en place de cookies. Un tel paramétrage du navigateur Internet utilisé empêcherait également Google de placer un cookie sur le système informatique de la personne concernée. En outre, un cookie déjà créé par Google Analytics peut être supprimé à tout moment via le navigateur Internet ou d'autres logiciels.

En outre, la personne concernée a la possibilité de s'opposer à la publicité basée sur les intérêts de Google. Pour ce faire, la personne concernée doit appeler le lien www.google.de/settings/ads à partir de n'importe quel navigateur Internet qu'elle utilise et y effectuer les réglages souhaités.
Vous trouverez de plus amples informations ainsi que les dispositions de Google en matière de protection des données sur le site https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.

####  18. Dispositions relatives à la protection des données concernant l'utilisation et l'application de Google AdWords

Le responsable du traitement a intégré Google AdWords sur ce site web. Google AdWords est un service de publicité sur Internet qui permet aux annonceurs de placer des annonces dans les résultats du moteur de recherche de Google ainsi que dans le réseau publicitaire de Google. Google AdWords permet à un annonceur de prédéfinir certains mots clés qui seront utilisés pour afficher une annonce dans les résultats du moteur de recherche de Google uniquement lorsque l'utilisateur utilise le moteur de recherche pour obtenir un résultat pertinent selon les mots clés. Dans le réseau publicitaire de Google, les annonces sont diffusées sur des sites web thématiques au moyen d'un algorithme automatique et en fonction des mots clés définis au préalable.

La société exploitante des services Google AdWords est Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, États-Unis.

L'objectif de Google AdWords est de faire de la publicité pour notre site web en affichant des publicités pertinentes en fonction des centres d'intérêt sur les sites web d'entreprises tierces et dans les résultats du moteur de recherche Google et d'afficher des publicités de tiers sur notre site web.

Si une personne concernée accède à notre site Internet par le biais d'une annonce Google, un cookie dit de conversion sera stocké par Google sur le système informatique de la personne concernée. L’explication des cookies a déjà été donné ci-dessus. Un cookie de conversion perd sa validité après trente jours et n'est pas utilisé pour identifier la personne concernée. Le cookie de conversion est utilisé pour savoir si certaines sous-pages ont été visitées sur notre site web, par exemple le panier d'un système de boutique en ligne, à condition que le cookie n'ait pas encore expiré. Grâce au cookie de conversion, Google et nous-mêmes pouvons savoir si une personne concernée qui a accédé à notre site web via une annonce AdWords a généré un chiffre d'affaires, autrement dit a réalisé ou annulé un achat de marchandises.

Les données et informations collectées par l'utilisation du cookie de conversion sont utilisées par Google pour créer des statistiques de visite de notre site web. Ces statistiques de visite sont à leur tour utilisées par nous pour déterminer le nombre total d'utilisateurs qui ont été dirigés vers nous grâce à des annonces AdWords. Cela nous aide à déterminer le succès ou l'échec de l'annonce AdWords respective afin de les optimiser à l'avenir. Ni notre entreprise ni les autres annonceurs de Google AdWords ne reçoivent de Google des informations permettant d'identifier la personne concernée.

Au moyen du cookie de conversion, des informations personnelles sont stockées, par exemple les pages Internet visitées par la personne concernée. Chaque fois que la personne concernée visite notre site Internet, des données personnelles, y compris l'adresse IP de la connexion Internet utilisée par la personne concernée, sont transmises à Google aux États-Unis d'Amérique. Ces données personnelles sont stockées par Google aux États-Unis d'Amérique. Google est susceptible de communiquer à des tiers les données personnelles collectées dans le cadre du processus technique.

La personne concernée peut empêcher la mise en place de cookies par notre site Internet, comme déjà décrit ci-dessus, à tout moment au moyen d'un réglage approprié du navigateur Internet utilisé et ainsi s'opposer définitivement à la mise en place de cookies. Un tel paramétrage du navigateur Internet utilisé empêcherait également Google de placer un cookie de conversion sur le système informatique de la personne concernée. En outre, un cookie déjà créé par Google AdWords peut être supprimé à tout moment via le navigateur Internet ou d'autres logiciels.
La personne concernée a la possibilité de s'opposer à la publicité basée sur les intérêts de Google. Pour ce faire, elle doit cliquer sur le lien www.google.de/settings/ads à partir de n'importe quel navigateur Internet qu'elle utilise et y effectuer les réglages souhaités.

####  19. Dispositions relatives à la protection des données concernant l'utilisation et l'application de Twitter

Le contrôleur a intégré des composants de Twitter sur ce site web. Twitter est un service de microblogage multilingue accessible au public, sur lequel les utilisateurs peuvent publier et diffuser des "tweets", c'est-à-dire des messages courts limités à 280 caractères. Ces messages courts sont accessibles à tous, y compris aux personnes qui ne sont pas inscrites sur Twitter. Toutefois, les tweets sont également affichés pour les "followers" de l'utilisateur concerné. Les followers sont d'autres utilisateurs de Twitter qui suivent les tweets d'un utilisateur. En outre, Twitter permet de s'adresser à un large public par le biais de hashtags, de liens ou de retweets.

Vous trouverez de plus amples informations sur les boutons Twitter à l'adresse https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. Dans le cadre de cette procédure technique, Twitter reçoit la connaissance de la sous-page spécifique de notre site web qui est visitée par la personne concernée. L'intégration du composant Twitter a pour but de permettre à nos utilisateurs de diffuser le contenu de ce site, de faire connaître ce site dans le monde numérique et d'augmenter le nombre de nos visiteurs.

Si la personne concernée est connectée à Twitter en même temps, Twitter reconnaît quelle sous-page spécifique de notre site Web la personne visite à chaque clic vers notre site Web, et ce pour toute la durée de leur présence. Ces informations sont collectées par le composant Twitter et attribuées par Twitter au compte de la personne concernée. Si la personne concernée active l'un des boutons Twitter intégrés sur notre site web, les données et informations ainsi transmises seront attribuées au compte utilisateur personnel de la personne concernée et seront par conséquent stockées puis traitées par Twitter.

Twitter reçoit toujours l'information, via le composant Twitter, que la personne concernée a visité notre site web si la personne concernée est simultanément connectée à Twitter au moment de l'appel de notre site web ; ceci a lieu indépendamment du fait que la personne concernée clique ou non sur le composant Twitter.

Les dispositions relatives à la protection des données publiées par YouTube, qui peuvent être consultées à l'adresse https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/, fournissent des informations sur la collecte, le traitement et l'utilisation des données personnelles par YouTube et Google.

####  21. Mode de paiement : dispositions relatives à la protection des données pour Payone comme mode de paiement carte de crédit

En sélectionnant l'option de paiement par carte de crédit, la personne concernée consent à la transmission à Payone des données personnelles nécessaires au traitement du paiement. La base juridique de la transmission des données est l'article 6 (1) a DSGVO (consentement) et l'article 6 (1) b DSGVO (traitement pour l'exécution d'un contrat) de PAYONE GmbH, Lyoner Straße 9, 60528 Frankfurt am Main, Allemagne. Courriel : privacy@payone.com

En effectuant un paiement par carte de crédit, vous consentez à la transmission à Payone de vos données personnelles, telles que votre nom, votre adresse e-mail et les détails de votre carte de crédit. Veuillez consulter la politique de confidentialité de Payone pour savoir quelles autres données sont collectées par Payone :
https://docs.payone.com/display/public/PLATFORM/Privacy+Politique

####  22. Base juridique du traitement

L'article 6 I lit. a RGDP sert de base juridique à notre entreprise pour les traitements dans lesquels nous obtenons le consentement pour une finalité de traitement spécifique. Si le traitement des données à caractère personnel est nécessaire à l'exécution d'un contrat auquel la personne concernée est partie, comme c'est le cas, par exemple, pour les opérations de traitement qui sont nécessaires à une livraison de marchandises ou à la fourniture de tout autre service ou contrepartie, le traitement est fondé sur l'article 6 I lit. b RGDP. Il en va de même pour les traitements nécessaires à l'exécution de mesures précontractuelles, par exemple en cas de demandes de renseignements sur nos produits ou services. Si notre société est soumise à une obligation légale par laquelle un traitement des données personnelles devient nécessaire, comme pour l'accomplissement d'obligations fiscales, le traitement est basé sur l'art. 6 I lit. c RGDP. Dans de rares cas, le traitement des données à caractère personnel pourrait devenir nécessaire pour protéger les intérêts vitaux de la personne concernée ou d'une autre personne physique. Ce serait le cas, par exemple, si un visiteur se blessait dans nos locaux et que, par conséquent, son nom, son âge, les détails de son assurance maladie ou d'autres informations vitales devaient être transmises à un médecin, un hôpital ou un autre tiers. Le traitement serait alors fondé sur l'article 6 I lit. d RGDP. Enfin, les opérations de traitement pourraient être fondées sur l'article 6 I lit. f RGDP.

Les opérations de traitement qui ne sont couvertes par aucune des bases juridiques susmentionnées sont fondées sur cette base juridique si le traitement est nécessaire pour protéger un intérêt légitime de notre société ou d'un tiers, à condition que les intérêts, les droits fondamentaux et les libertés de la personne concernée ne prévalent pas. Ces traitements nous sont autorisés notamment parce qu'ils ont été spécifiquement mentionnés par le législateur européen. À cet égard, elle a estimé qu'un intérêt légitime pouvait être présumé si la personne concernée est un client du responsable du traitement (considérant 47 phrase 2 RGDP).

####  23. Les intérêts légitimes du traitement poursuivis par le responsable du traitement ou un tiers.

Si le traitement des données à caractère personnel est fondé sur l'article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO, notre intérêt légitime est la conduite de nos affaires au profit du bien-être de tous nos employés et de nos actionnaires.

####  24. Durée pendant laquelle les données personnelles sont conservées

Le critère pour la durée de conservation des données personnelles est la période de conservation légale respective. À l'expiration de ce délai, les données correspondantes sont systématiquement supprimées, à condition qu'elles ne soient plus nécessaires à l'exécution ou au lancement du contrat.

####  25. Les dispositions légales ou contractuelles relatives à la fourniture de données à caractère personnel ; la nécessité de conclure le contrat ; l'obligation pour la personne concernée de fournir les données à caractère personnel ; les conséquences éventuelles de la non-fourniture.

Nous vous informons que la communication de données à caractère personnel est parfois exigée par la loi (les règlements fiscaux par exemple) ou peut également résulter de règlements contractuels (des informations sur le partenaire contractuel par exemple). Parfois, afin de conclure un contrat, il peut être nécessaire qu'une personne concernée nous fournisse des données à caractère personnel qui doivent ensuite être traitées par nous. Par exemple, la personne concernée est obligée de nous fournir des données personnelles si notre entreprise conclut un contrat avec elle. Le fait de ne pas fournir les données à caractère personnel signifierait que le contrat avec la personne concernée ne pourrait être conclu. Avant de fournir des données personnelles par la personne concernée, cette dernière doit contacter l'un de nos employés. Notre employé expliquera à la personne concernée, au cas par cas, si le don des données à caractère personnel est requise par la loi, par le contrat ou si elle est nécessaire à la conclusion du contrat. Ceci a lieu dans le cas où il existe une obligation de fournir les données à caractère personnel, ne sachant pas quelles seraient les conséquences du refus de fournir les données à caractère personnel.

####  26. Processeurs d'ordres

Nous faisons appel à des prestataires de services externes (processeurs de commandes), par exemple pour l'envoi de bulletins d'information, le traitement des paiements par carte de crédit ou les programmes de voyage. Un accord distinct sur le traitement des données relatives aux commandes a été conclu avec le prestataire de services afin de garantir la protection de vos données personnelles.

Si vous souhaitez savoir avec quels prestataires de services nous travaillons, vous pouvez nous en demander la liste. Pour ce faire, veuillez nous envoyer un courriel à confidentialite@venturatravel.org et nous vous ferons parvenir les informations demandées.

####  27. Mentions légales

Malgré un contrôle minutieux du contenu, nous n'assumons aucune responsabilité pour tous les liens externes présents sur notre site. Au moment de la création du lien, aucun contenu illégal n'était reconnaissable sur les pages externes. Toutefois, comme nous n'avons aucune influence sur la conception actuelle et future des sites externes, nous nous distançons expressément de leur contenu.

####  28. Existence d'une prise de décision automatisée

En tant qu'entreprise responsable, nous n'utilisons pas de prise de décision automatisée ni de profilage.

Cette déclaration de protection des données a été créée par le générateur de déclaration de protection des données de la DGD Deutsche Gesellschaft für Datenschutz GmbH, qui agit en tant que délégué externe à la protection des données de Dachau, en coopération avec l'avocat en droit de la protection des données Christian Solmecke.

####  1. Definiciones de los términos

La declaración de protección de datos de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH se basa en los términos utilizados por la Directiva Europea y el Reglamento Enactor al emitir el Reglamento General de Protección de Datos (GDPR).

Para garantizarlo, nos gustaría explicar de antemano la terminología utilizada.

En esta política de privacidad utilizamos, entre otros, los siguientes términos:

#### a) Datos personales

#### b) Sujeto de Datos 

Se entiende por interesado toda persona física identificada o identificable cuyos datos personales son tratados por el responsable del tratamiento.

#### d) Restricción del procesamiento #### 

La restricción del tratamiento es el marcado de los datos personales almacenados con el objetivo de limitar su futuro tratamiento.

La elaboración de perfiles es cualquier tipo de tratamiento automatizado de datos personales que consiste en utilizar dichos datos personales para evaluar determinados aspectos personales relacionados con una persona física, en particular para analizar o predecir aspectos relacionados con el rendimiento laboral, la situación económica, la salud, las preferencias personales, los intereses, la fiabilidad, el comportamiento, la ubicación o el cambio de ubicación de dicha persona física.

#### f) Pseudonimización #### 

La pseudonimización es el tratamiento de datos personales de manera que los datos personales ya no puedan atribuirse a un sujeto de datos específico sin el uso de información adicional, siempre que dicha información adicional se mantenga separada y esté sujeta a medidas técnicas y organizativas para garantizar que los datos personales no se atribuyan a una persona física identificada o identificable.

#### g) Controlador o responsable del tratamiento de datos #### 

El responsable del tratamiento es la persona física o jurídica, autoridad pública, agencia u otro organismo que, solo o conjuntamente con otros, determina los fines y los medios del tratamiento de los datos personales. Cuando los fines y los medios de dicho tratamiento estén determinados por el Derecho de la Unión o de los Estados miembros, el responsable del tratamiento o los criterios específicos para su designación podrán estar previstos en el Derecho de la Unión o de los Estados miembros.

 

#### h) Procesador #### 

Encargado del tratamiento: persona física o jurídica, autoridad pública, agencia u otro organismo que trate datos personales por cuenta del responsable del tratamiento.

#### i) Destinatario #### 

Por destinatario se entenderá una persona física o jurídica, autoridad pública, agencia u otro organismo al que se comuniquen datos personales, sea o no un tercero. No obstante, no se considerarán destinatarios las autoridades públicas que puedan recibir datos personales en el contexto de una tarea de investigación específica en virtud del Derecho de la Unión o de los Estados miembros.

#### j) Terceras partes #### 

Por tercero se entiende una persona física o jurídica, autoridad pública, agencia u otro organismo distinto del interesado, del responsable del tratamiento, del encargado del tratamiento y de las personas autorizadas a tratar los datos personales bajo la responsabilidad directa del responsable del tratamiento o del encargado del tratamiento.

 

#### k) Consentimiento #### 

Por consentimiento se entenderá toda indicación libre de la voluntad del interesado para el caso concreto de manera informada e inequívoca, en forma de declaración o cualquier otro acto afirmativo inequívoco por el que el interesado indique que consiente el tratamiento de los datos personales que le conciernen.

#### 4. Cookies y otras tecnologías de seguimiento #### 

Las páginas de Internet de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH utilizan cookies y otras tecnologías de seguimiento (como el almacenamiento local HTML5). Las cookies son archivos de texto que se almacenan en un sistema informático a través de un navegador de Internet.

 

Numerosos sitios y servidores de Internet utilizan cookies. Muchas cookies contienen el llamado ID de cookie. Un ID de cookie es un identificador único de la cookie. Consiste en una cadena de caracteres mediante la cual las páginas y servidores de Internet pueden ser asignados al navegador de Internet específico en el que se almacenó la cookie. Esto permite a las páginas de Internet y a los servidores visitados distinguir el navegador individual del interesado de otros navegadores de Internet que contienen otras cookies. Un navegador de Internet específico puede ser reconocido e identificado a través de la identificación única de la cookie.

 

Mediante el uso de cookies, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH puede proporcionar a los usuarios de este sitio web servicios más fáciles de usar que no serían posibles sin la configuración de las cookies.

 

Mediante una cookie, la información y las ofertas de nuestro sitio web pueden optimizarse para el usuario. Las cookies nos permiten, como ya se ha mencionado, reconocer a los usuarios de nuestro sitio web. El objetivo de este reconocimiento es facilitar a los usuarios el uso de nuestro sitio web. Por ejemplo, el usuario de un sitio web que utiliza cookies no tiene que volver a introducir sus datos de acceso cada vez que visita el sitio web, ya que esto lo gestiona el sitio web y la cookie almacenada en el sistema informático del usuario. Otro ejemplo es la cookie de un carrito de la compra en una tienda online. La tienda en línea recuerda los artículos que un cliente ha colocado en la cesta de la compra virtual a través de una cookie.

 

El interesado puede impedir en cualquier momento la instalación de cookies por parte de nuestro sitio web mediante una configuración adecuada del navegador de Internet utilizado y, de este modo, oponerse permanentemente a la instalación de cookies. Además, las cookies ya instaladas pueden eliminarse en cualquier momento a través de un navegador de Internet u otros programas de software. Esto es posible en todos los navegadores de Internet habituales. Si el interesado desactiva la configuración de las cookies en el navegador de Internet utilizado, es posible que no se puedan utilizar completamente todas las funciones de nuestro sitio web.

#### 5. Recogida de datos e información general #### 

El sitio web de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH recopila una serie de datos e información generales con cada llamada al sitio web por parte de un sujeto de datos o un sistema automatizado. Estos datos e información generales se almacenan en los archivos de registro del servidor. Se pueden recoger los siguientes datos (1) los tipos y versiones de navegador utilizados, (2) el sistema operativo utilizado por el sistema de acceso, (3) el sitio web desde el que un sistema de acceso accede a nuestro sitio web (el llamado referrer), (4) los sub-sitios web a los que se accede a través de un sistema de acceso en nuestro sitio web, (5) la fecha y hora de acceso al sitio web, (6) una dirección de protocolo de Internet (dirección IP), (7) el proveedor de servicios de Internet del sistema de acceso y (8) otros datos e información similares que sirven para evitar el peligro en caso de ataques a nuestros sistemas de tecnología de la información.

 

Al utilizar estos datos e información generales, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH no saca ninguna conclusión sobre el interesado. Más bien, esta información es necesaria (1) para ofrecer los contenidos de nuestro sitio web correctamente, (2) para optimizar los contenidos de nuestro sitio web y la publicidad de los mismos, (3) para garantizar la funcionalidad a largo plazo de nuestros sistemas de tecnología de la información y la tecnología de nuestro sitio web, y (4) para proporcionar a las autoridades policiales la información necesaria para el procesamiento en caso de un ciberataque. Por lo tanto, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH analiza los datos e información recogidos de forma anónima, por un lado, y por otro, con el objetivo de aumentar la protección de datos y la seguridad de los datos de nuestra empresa, de forma que podamos garantizar en última instancia un nivel óptimo de protección de los datos personales que procesamos. Los datos anónimos de los archivos de registro del servidor se almacenan por separado de los datos personales proporcionados por el interesado.

#### 6. Inscripción en nuestro sitio web #### 

El interesado tiene la posibilidad de registrarse en el sitio web del responsable del tratamiento proporcionando datos personales. Los datos personales que se transmiten al responsable del tratamiento en el proceso resultan de la respectiva máscara de entrada utilizada para el registro. Los datos personales introducidos por el interesado se recogen y almacenan exclusivamente para uso interno del responsable del tratamiento y para sus propios fines. El responsable del tratamiento puede disponer que los datos se transfieran a uno o varios encargados del tratamiento, por ejemplo un proveedor de servicios de paquetería, que también utilizará los datos personales exclusivamente para un uso interno atribuible al responsable del tratamiento.

 

Al registrarse en el sitio web del responsable del tratamiento, también se almacenan la dirección IP asignada por el proveedor de servicios de Internet (PSI) del interesado, la fecha y la hora del registro. El almacenamiento de estos datos tiene lugar con el trasfondo de que sólo así se puede prevenir el uso indebido de nuestros servicios y, en caso necesario, estos datos permiten esclarecer los delitos cometidos. En este sentido, el almacenamiento de estos datos es necesario para la protección del responsable del tratamiento. Por principio, estos datos no se transmiten a terceros, a no ser que exista una obligación legal de transmitirlos o que la transmisión sirva para la persecución penal.

 

El registro del interesado mediante el suministro voluntario de datos personales sirve para que el responsable del tratamiento ofrezca al interesado contenidos o servicios que, por su naturaleza, sólo pueden ofrecerse a los usuarios registrados. Las personas registradas son libres de modificar en cualquier momento los datos personales facilitados durante el registro o de eliminarlos por completo del archivo de datos del responsable del tratamiento.

 

El responsable del tratamiento proporcionará en todo momento a cualquier interesado que lo solicite información sobre los datos personales almacenados sobre él. Además, el responsable del tratamiento corregirá o suprimirá los datos personales a petición o indicación del interesado, siempre que ello no entre en conflicto con las obligaciones legales de conservación. Todo el personal del responsable del tratamiento estará a disposición del interesado como personas de contacto en este contexto.

#### 7. Suscripción a nuestro boletín de noticias #### 

En el sitio web de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH, los usuarios tienen la oportunidad de suscribirse al boletín informativo de nuestra empresa. Los datos personales transmitidos al controlador cuando el usuario se suscribe a nuestro boletín de noticias se especificarán en la máscara de entrada utilizada para este fin. Ventura TRAVEL GmbH informa periódicamente a sus clientes y socios comerciales mediante un boletín de noticias sobre las ofertas de la empresa. Básicamente, el boletín de nuestra empresa sólo puede ser recibido por el interesado, si (1) éste dispone de una dirección de correo electrónico válida y (2) se registra para el envío del boletín. Por motivos legales, se enviará un correo electrónico de confirmación a la dirección de correo electrónico introducida por el interesado por primera vez para el envío del boletín mediante el procedimiento de doble opt-in. Este correo electrónico de confirmación sirve para verificar si el titular de la dirección de correo electrónico como sujeto de los datos ha autorizado la recepción del boletín.

 

Al registrarse en el boletín, también almacenamos la dirección IP del sistema informático utilizado por el interesado en el momento del registro, asignada por el proveedor de servicios de Internet (PSI), así como la fecha y la hora del registro. La recopilación de estos datos es necesaria para poder rastrear el (posible) uso indebido de la dirección de correo electrónico de un sujeto de datos en un momento posterior y, por tanto, sirve para la protección legal del responsable del tratamiento.

 

Los datos personales recogidos en el marco de una inscripción al boletín se utilizan exclusivamente para el envío de nuestro boletín. Además, los suscriptores del boletín podrían ser informados por correo electrónico si esto es necesario para el funcionamiento del servicio del boletín o de un registro relacionado, como podría ser el caso en caso de cambios en la oferta del boletín o cambios en las circunstancias técnicas. Ningún dato personal recogido en el marco del servicio de boletín de noticias será transmitido a terceros. La suscripción a nuestro boletín puede ser cancelada por el interesado en cualquier momento. El consentimiento para el almacenamiento de datos personales que el interesado nos ha dado para el envío del boletín puede ser revocado en cualquier momento. Para revocar el consentimiento, se puede encontrar un enlace correspondiente en cada boletín. Además, también es posible darse de baja del envío del boletín informativo directamente en el sitio web del responsable del tratamiento en cualquier momento o notificarlo al responsable del tratamiento de otra manera.

#### 8. Seguimiento del boletín de noticias #### 

Los boletines informativos de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH contienen los llamados píxeles de seguimiento. Un píxel de seguimiento es un gráfico en miniatura que se incrusta en dichos correos electrónicos que se envían en formato HTML para permitir el registro y el análisis de los archivos de registro. Esto permite una evaluación estadística del éxito o fracaso de las campañas de marketing online. Sobre la base del píxel de seguimiento incrustado, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH puede ver si un correo electrónico fue abierto por un sujeto de datos y cuándo, y qué enlaces del correo electrónico fueron llamados por el sujeto de datos.

 

Estos datos personales recogidos a través de los píxeles de seguimiento contenidos en los boletines informativos son almacenados y analizados por el responsable del tratamiento con el fin de optimizar el envío de boletines informativos y adaptar mejor el contenido de futuros boletines a los intereses del interesado. Estos datos personales no se comunicarán a terceros. Los interesados tienen derecho a revocar en cualquier momento la declaración de consentimiento que hayan dado a este respecto a través del procedimiento de doble opción. Tras la revocación, estos datos personales serán eliminados por el responsable del tratamiento. Ventura TRAVEL GmbH considera automáticamente como revocación la renuncia a recibir el boletín informativo.

#### 9. Posibilidad de contacto a través del sitio web #### 

Sobre la base de las disposiciones legales, el sitio web de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH contiene información que permite un contacto electrónico rápido con nuestra empresa, así como la comunicación directa con nosotros, que también incluye una dirección general del llamado correo electrónico (dirección de correo electrónico). Si un interesado se pone en contacto con el responsable del tratamiento por correo electrónico, mediante un formulario de contacto, o mediante una función de chat, los datos personales transmitidos por el interesado se almacenarán automáticamente. Los datos personales transmitidos de forma voluntaria por un interesado al responsable del tratamiento se almacenarán con el fin de procesar o contactar con el interesado. No se revelarán estos datos personales a terceros.

#### 10. Función de comentarios en el blog del sitio web #### 

Ventura TRAVEL GmbH ofrece a los usuarios la posibilidad de dejar comentarios individuales en las contribuciones de un blog, que se encuentra en el sitio web del controlador. Un blog es un portal mantenido en un sitio web, normalmente visible públicamente, en el que una o más personas, denominadas bloggers o blogueros web, pueden publicar artículos o escribir pensamientos en las denominadas entradas de blog. Por lo general, las entradas del blog pueden ser comentadas por terceros.

 

Si un sujeto de datos deja un comentario en el blog publicado en este sitio web, además de los comentarios dejados por el sujeto de datos, se almacenará y publicará información sobre la hora de entrada del comentario y el nombre de usuario (seudónimo) elegido por el sujeto de datos. Además, también se registra la dirección IP asignada por el proveedor de servicios de Internet (PSI) del interesado. Este almacenamiento de la dirección IP se realiza por razones de seguridad y en caso de que el interesado viole los derechos de terceros al publicar un comentario o publique contenido ilegal. El almacenamiento de estos datos personales se realiza, por tanto, en interés del responsable del tratamiento, de modo que éste pueda exculparse en caso necesario en caso de infracción. No se revelan estos datos personales recogidos a terceros, a menos que dicha revelación sea exigida por la ley o sirva para la defensa legal del responsable del tratamiento.

#### 11. Suscripción de comentarios en el blog del sitio de Internet #### 

Los comentarios realizados en el blog de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH pueden ser suscritos generalmente por terceros. En particular, es posible que un comentarista se suscriba a los comentarios que siguen a su comentario en una entrada específica del blog.

 

Si un sujeto de datos opta por la opción de suscribirse a los comentarios, el responsable del tratamiento enviará un correo electrónico de confirmación automático para verificar en un procedimiento de doble opt-in que el propietario de la dirección de correo electrónico especificada ha optado efectivamente por esta opción. La opción de suscribirse a los comentarios puede cancelarse en cualquier momento.

#### 12. Borrado y bloqueo rutinario de datos personales #### 

El responsable del tratamiento tratará y almacenará los datos personales del interesado sólo durante el período de tiempo necesario para lograr el propósito del almacenamiento o cuando lo disponga el legislador de la Directiva y el Reglamento europeos u otro legislador en las leyes o reglamentos a los que esté sujeto el responsable del tratamiento.

 

Si la finalidad del almacenamiento deja de aplicarse o si expira un período de almacenamiento prescrito por el legislador de la Directiva y el Reglamento europeos o por otro legislador competente, los datos personales se bloquearán o eliminarán de forma rutinaria de acuerdo con las disposiciones legales.

#### 13. Derechos del interesado #### 

#### a) Derecho a la confirmación #### 

Todo interesado tiene el derecho que le otorgan la Directiva y el Reglamento europeos a obtener confirmación del responsable del tratamiento sobre si se están tratando datos personales que le conciernen.

Toda persona afectada por el tratamiento de datos personales tiene derecho, concedido por la Directiva y el Reglamento europeos Maker, a obtener del responsable del tratamiento, en cualquier momento y de forma gratuita, información sobre los datos personales almacenados sobre ella y una copia de dicha información.

Además, el interesado tendrá derecho a obtener información sobre si los datos personales se han transferido a un tercer país o a una organización internacional. Si este es el caso, el interesado también tiene derecho a obtener información sobre las garantías adecuadas en relación con la transferencia.

 

Si el interesado desea ejercer este derecho de acceso, puede dirigirse en cualquier momento a un empleado del responsable del tratamiento.

#### c) Derecho de rectificación #### 

Toda persona afectada por el tratamiento de datos personales tiene el derecho que le otorgan la Directiva y el Reglamento europeos a exigir la rectificación inmediata de cualquier dato personal inexacto que le afecte. Además, el interesado tiene derecho a solicitar que se completen los datos personales incompletos -también mediante una declaración complementaria- teniendo en cuenta los fines del tratamiento.

 

Si el interesado desea ejercer este derecho de rectificación, puede dirigirse en cualquier momento a cualquier empleado del responsable del tratamiento.

#### d) Derecho al borrado (derecho al olvido) #### 

Toda persona afectada por el tratamiento de datos personales tiene derecho a obtener del responsable del tratamiento la supresión sin demora de los datos personales que le conciernen, cuando se aplique uno de los siguientes motivos y en la medida en que el tratamiento ya no sea necesario:



*   Los datos personales se recogieron o se trataron de otro modo con fines para los que ya no son necesarios.
*   El interesado revoca su consentimiento en el que se basó el tratamiento de acuerdo con el art. 6(1)(a) del GDPR o del Art. 9(2)(a) del GDPR y no existe ninguna otra base legal para el tratamiento.
*   El interesado se opone al tratamiento con arreglo al artículo 21 (1) del GDPR y no existen motivos legítimos imperiosos para el tratamiento, o el interesado se opone al tratamiento con arreglo al artículo 21 (2) del GDPR.
*   Los datos personales se han tratado de forma ilegal.
*   La supresión de los datos personales es necesaria para el cumplimiento de una obligación legal en virtud del Derecho de la Unión o de los Estados miembros a la que está sujeto el responsable del tratamiento.
*   Los datos personales se han recogido en relación con los servicios de la sociedad de la información ofrecidos de conformidad con el artículo 8(1) del GDPR.

Si se aplica uno de los motivos mencionados anteriormente, y el interesado desea solicitar la supresión de los datos personales almacenados por Ventura TRAVEL GmbH, podrá dirigirse en cualquier momento a cualquier empleado del responsable del tratamiento. El empleado de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH se encargará de que la solicitud de borrado se cumpla inmediatamente.

 

Si los datos personales han sido hechos públicos por Ventura TRAVEL GmbH y nuestra empresa es responsable de ellos según el Art. 17 Para. 1 del GDPR, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH implementará medidas razonables, incluyendo medidas técnicas, para compensar a otros controladores de datos por el procesamiento de los datos personales publicados, teniendo en cuenta la tecnología disponible y el costo de implementación, para informar al sujeto de los datos que ha solicitado a esos otros controladores de datos que borren todos los enlaces a los datos personales o copias o réplicas de los datos personales, a menos que el procesamiento sea necesario. El empleado de Ventura TRAVEL GmbH se encargará de lo necesario en casos individuales.

*   El interesado impugna la exactitud de los datos personales durante un período que permite al responsable del tratamiento verificar la exactitud de los datos personales.
*   El tratamiento es ilegal, el interesado se opone a la supresión de los datos personales y solicita en su lugar la limitación del uso de los mismos.
*   El responsable del tratamiento ya no necesita los datos personales para los fines del tratamiento, pero el interesado los necesita para la formulación, el ejercicio o la defensa de reclamaciones legales.
*   El interesado se ha opuesto al tratamiento de conformidad con el artículo 21(1) del GDPR y aún no está claro si los motivos legítimos del responsable del tratamiento prevalecen sobre los del interesado.

#### f) Derecho a la portabilidad de los datos #### 

Toda persona afectada por el tratamiento de datos personales tiene derecho a recibir los datos personales que le conciernen, facilitados por el interesado a un responsable del tratamiento, en un formato estructurado, de uso común y lectura mecánica. También tiene derecho a transmitir dichos datos a otro responsable del tratamiento sin que el responsable del tratamiento al que se han facilitado los datos personales se lo impida, siempre que el tratamiento se base en el consentimiento de conformidad con el artículo 6(1)(a) del GDPR o con el artículo 9(2)(a) del GDPR, o en un contrato de conformidad con el artículo 6(1)(b) del GDPR, y el tratamiento se lleve a cabo por medios automatizados, a menos que el tratamiento sea necesario para el cumplimiento de una misión de interés público o en el ejercicio de poderes públicos conferidos al responsable del tratamiento.

 

Además, al ejercer el derecho a la portabilidad de los datos de conformidad con el artículo 20(1) del RGPD, el interesado tendrá derecho a obtener que los datos personales se transfieran directamente de un responsable del tratamiento a otro, siempre que sea técnicamente posible y que ello no afecte negativamente a los derechos y libertades de otras personas.

Esto también se aplica a la elaboración de perfiles basados en estas disposiciones.

 

Ventura TRAVEL GmbH dejará de tratar los datos personales en caso de oposición, a menos que podamos demostrar motivos legítimos imperiosos para el tratamiento que prevalezcan sobre los intereses, los derechos y las libertades del interesado, o para la formulación, el ejercicio o la defensa de reclamaciones judiciales.

#### h) Decisiones automatizadas en casos individuales, incluida la elaboración de perfiles #### 

Todo interesado afectado por el tratamiento de datos personales tendrá derecho, otorgado por la Directiva Europea y el Reglamento, a no ser objeto de una decisión basada únicamente en el tratamiento automatizado, incluida la elaboración de perfiles, que produzca efectos jurídicos sobre él o que le afecte significativamente de forma similar, a menos que la decisión (1) sea necesaria para celebrar o la ejecución de un contrato entre el interesado y el responsable del tratamiento, o (2) esté permitida por el Derecho de la Unión o de los Estados miembros al que esté sujeto el responsable del tratamiento y dicho Derecho contenga medidas adecuadas para salvaguardar los derechos y libertades del interesado y sus intereses legítimos, o (3) se tome con el consentimiento explícito del interesado.

 

Si la decisión (1) es necesaria para celebrar o ejecutar un contrato entre el interesado y el responsable del tratamiento, o (2) se toma con el consentimiento explícito del interesado, Ventura TRAVEL GmbH aplicará las medidas adecuadas para salvaguardar los derechos y libertades del interesado y sus intereses legítimos, lo que incluye, como mínimo, el derecho a obtener la participación del interesado por parte del responsable del tratamiento, a expresar su punto de vista y a impugnar la decisión.

#### 14. Protección de datos durante las solicitudes y el proceso de solicitud #### 

El responsable del tratamiento recoge y procesa los datos personales de los solicitantes con el fin de gestionar el procedimiento de solicitud. El tratamiento también puede realizarse por medios electrónicos. Este es el caso, en particular, cuando un solicitante presenta los documentos de solicitud pertinentes al responsable del tratamiento por medios electrónicos, por ejemplo, por correo electrónico o a través de un formulario web situado en el sitio web. Si el responsable del tratamiento celebra un contrato de trabajo con un solicitante, los datos transmitidos se almacenarán con el fin de procesar la relación laboral de conformidad con las disposiciones legales. Si el responsable del tratamiento no celebra un contrato de trabajo con el solicitante, los documentos de la solicitud se eliminarán automáticamente dos meses después de la notificación de la decisión de denegación, siempre que ningún otro interés legítimo del responsable del tratamiento entre en conflicto con dicha eliminación. Otro interés legítimo en este sentido es, por ejemplo, la obligación de aportar pruebas en procedimientos en virtud de la Ley General de Igualdad de Trato (AGG).

#### 15. Política de privacidad sobre el uso y la aplicación de Facebook #### 

El controlador ha integrado componentes de la empresa Facebook en este sitio web. Facebook es una red social.

 

Una red social es un lugar de encuentro social operado en Internet, una comunidad en línea que generalmente permite a los usuarios comunicarse entre sí e interactuar en el espacio virtual. Una red social puede servir de plataforma para compartir opiniones y experiencias o permite a la comunidad de Internet proporcionar información personal o relacionada con la empresa. Facebook permite a los usuarios de la red social crear perfiles privados, subir fotos y establecer redes mediante solicitudes de amistad, entre otras cosas.

 

La empresa operadora de Facebook es Facebook, Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. El responsable del tratamiento de los datos personales, si el interesado vive fuera de Estados Unidos o Canadá, es Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublín 2, Irlanda.

 

Cada vez que se accede a una de las páginas individuales de este sitio web operado por el responsable del tratamiento y en la que se ha integrado un componente de Facebook (plug-in de Facebook), el navegador de Internet en el sistema de tecnología de la información del sujeto de los datos es causado automáticamente por el respectivo componente de Facebook para descargar una representación del componente de Facebook correspondiente de Facebook. En https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE encontrará un resumen completo de todos los plug-ins de Facebook. En el marco de este procedimiento técnico, Facebook recibe información sobre la subpágina concreta de nuestro sitio web que ha visitado el interesado.

 

Si el interesado está conectado a Facebook al mismo tiempo, Facebook reconoce qué subpágina específica de nuestro sitio web está visitando el interesado cada vez que llama a nuestro sitio web y durante toda la estancia en nuestro sitio web. Esta información la recoge el componente de Facebook y la asigna a la cuenta de Facebook del interesado. Si el interesado activa uno de los botones de Facebook integrados en nuestro sitio web, por ejemplo el botón "Me gusta", o si el interesado publica un comentario, Facebook asigna esta información a la cuenta personal de usuario de Facebook del interesado y almacena estos datos personales.

 

Facebook siempre recibe información a través del componente de Facebook de que el interesado ha visitado nuestro sitio web si el interesado ha iniciado simultáneamente la sesión en Facebook en el momento de acceder a nuestro sitio web; esto tiene lugar independientemente de que el interesado haga clic en el componente de Facebook o no. Si el interesado no desea que esta información se transmita a Facebook, puede evitar la transmisión cerrando la sesión de su cuenta de Facebook antes de acceder a nuestro sitio web.

 

La política de datos publicada por Facebook, a la que se puede acceder en https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, proporciona información sobre la recogida, el tratamiento y el uso de los datos personales por parte de Facebook.

#### 16. Política de privacidad sobre el uso y aplicación de Google Analytics (con función de anonimización) #### 

El controlador ha integrado el componente de Google Analytics (con función de anonimización) en este sitio web. Google Analytics es un servicio de análisis web. El análisis web consiste en la recogida, compilación y evaluación de datos sobre el comportamiento de los visitantes de los sitios web. Un servicio de análisis web recopila, entre otras cosas, datos sobre el sitio web desde el que un sujeto de datos llegó a un sitio web (los denominados referentes), a qué subpáginas del sitio web se accedió o con qué frecuencia y durante cuánto tiempo se vio una subpágina. Un análisis web se utiliza principalmente para la optimización de un sitio web y para el análisis de la relación coste-beneficio de la publicidad en Internet.

La empresa operadora del componente Google Analytics es Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

 

El responsable del tratamiento utiliza el aditivo "_gat._anonymizeIp" para el análisis de la web a través de Google Analytics. Mediante este aditivo, la dirección IP de la conexión a Internet del interesado es acortada y anonimizada por Google si el acceso a nuestras páginas de Internet se produce desde un Estado miembro de la Unión Europea o desde otro Estado parte del Acuerdo sobre el Espacio Económico Europeo.

 

La finalidad del componente de Google Analytics es analizar el flujo de visitantes de nuestro sitio web. Google utiliza los datos y la información obtenida, entre otras cosas, para evaluar el uso de nuestro sitio web, para compilar informes en línea para nosotros mostrando las actividades en nuestro sitio web, y para proporcionar otros servicios relacionados con el uso de nuestro sitio web.

 

Google Analytics instala una cookie en el sistema informático del interesado. Lo que son las cookies ya se ha explicado anteriormente. Mediante la instalación de la cookie, Google puede analizar el uso de nuestro sitio web. Cada vez que se accede a una de las páginas individuales de este sitio web, operado por el controlador y en el que se ha integrado un componente de Google Analytics, el navegador de Internet en el sistema de tecnología de la información del sujeto de los datos es causado automáticamente por el respectivo componente de Google Analytics para transmitir datos a Google con el fin de análisis en línea. Como parte de este proceso técnico, Google obtiene conocimiento de datos personales, como la dirección IP del interesado, que Google utiliza, entre otras cosas, para rastrear el origen de los visitantes y los clics y, posteriormente, permitir el cálculo de las comisiones.

 

Mediante la cookie se almacena información personal, como por ejemplo la hora de acceso, el lugar desde el que se originó el acceso y la frecuencia de las visitas a nuestro sitio web por parte del interesado. Cada vez que el interesado visita nuestro sitio web, estos datos personales, incluida la dirección IP de la conexión a Internet utilizada por el interesado, se transmiten a Google en los Estados Unidos de América. Estos datos personales son almacenados por Google en los Estados Unidos de América. Google puede revelar a terceros estos datos personales recogidos mediante el procedimiento técnico.

 

El interesado puede impedir en cualquier momento la instalación de cookies en nuestro sitio web, tal y como se ha descrito anteriormente, mediante una configuración adecuada del navegador de Internet utilizado y así oponerse de forma permanente a la instalación de cookies. Esta configuración del navegador de Internet utilizado también impedirá que Google instale una cookie en el sistema informático del interesado. Además, una cookie ya establecida por Google Analytics puede ser eliminada en cualquier momento a través del navegador de Internet u otros programas de software.

 

Además, el interesado tiene la posibilidad de oponerse a la recopilación de datos generados por Google Analytics y relacionados con el uso de este sitio web, así como al tratamiento de estos datos por parte de Google, y de impedir dicho tratamiento. Para ello, el interesado debe descargar e instalar un complemento del navegador en el enlace [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Este complemento del navegador indica a Google Analytics, a través de JavaScript, que no se pueden transmitir a Google Analytics datos e información sobre las visitas a las páginas de Internet. La instalación del complemento del navegador es considerada por Google como una objeción. Si el sistema informático del interesado se borra, se formatea o se vuelve a instalar posteriormente, el interesado deberá volver a instalar el complemento del navegador para desactivar Google Analytics. Siempre que el complemento del navegador sea desinstalado o desactivado por el interesado o por otra persona atribuible a su ámbito de control, existe la posibilidad de reinstalar o reactivar el complemento del navegador.

#### 17. Política de privacidad sobre el uso y la aplicación de Google Remarketing #### 

El controlador ha integrado los servicios de Google Remarketing en este sitio web. Google Remarketing es una función de Google AdWords que permite a una empresa mostrar anuncios a los usuarios de Internet que han visitado previamente el sitio web de la empresa. La integración de Google Remarketing permite a una empresa crear anuncios relacionados con el usuario y, en consecuencia, mostrar anuncios relevantes para sus intereses al usuario de Internet.

 

La empresa operadora de los servicios de Google Remarketing es Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

 

El objetivo de Google Remarketing es la visualización de publicidad relevante para los intereses del usuario. Google Remarketing nos permite mostrar anuncios a través de la red publicitaria de Google o hacer que se muestren en otras páginas de Internet que se adaptan a las necesidades e intereses individuales de los usuarios de Internet. 

Google Remarketing instala una cookie en el sistema informático del interesado. Ya se ha explicado anteriormente qué son las cookies. Mediante la instalación de la cookie, Google puede reconocer al visitante de nuestro sitio web cuando éste visita posteriormente sitios web que también son miembros de la red publicitaria de Google. Cada vez que se accede a un sitio web en el que se ha integrado el servicio de remarketing de Google, el navegador de Internet del interesado se identifica automáticamente ante Google. En el marco de este procedimiento técnico, Google obtiene conocimiento de datos personales, como la dirección IP o el comportamiento de navegación del usuario, que Google utiliza, entre otras cosas, para mostrar publicidad relevante para sus intereses.

 

Mediante la cookie se almacena información personal, por ejemplo, las páginas de Internet visitadas por el interesado. Cada vez que el interesado visita nuestro sitio web, los datos personales, incluida la dirección IP de la conexión a Internet utilizada por el interesado, se transmiten a Google en los Estados Unidos de América. Estos datos personales son almacenados por Google en los Estados Unidos de América. Google puede revelar a terceros estos datos personales recogidos mediante el procedimiento técnico.

 

El interesado puede impedir en cualquier momento la instalación de cookies en nuestro sitio web, tal y como se ha descrito anteriormente, mediante una configuración adecuada del navegador de Internet utilizado y así oponerse de forma permanente a la instalación de cookies.

#### 18. Política de privacidad sobre el uso y la aplicación de Google AdWords #### 

El controlador ha integrado Google AdWords en este sitio web. Google AdWords es un servicio de publicidad en Internet que permite a los anunciantes publicar anuncios en los resultados del motor de búsqueda de Google, así como en la red publicitaria de Google. Google AdWords permite al anunciante especificar previamente determinadas palabras clave, mediante las cuales se muestra un anuncio en los resultados del motor de búsqueda de Google exclusivamente cuando el usuario obtiene un resultado de búsqueda relevante para la palabra clave utilizando el motor de búsqueda. En la red publicitaria de Google, los anuncios se distribuyen en sitios web relevantes para el tema mediante un algoritmo automático y de acuerdo con las palabras clave previamente definidas.

 

La empresa operadora de los servicios de Google AdWords es Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

 

La finalidad de Google AdWords es publicitar nuestro sitio web mostrando publicidad de interés en los sitios web de terceras empresas y en los resultados del motor de búsqueda de Google, así como mostrar publicidad de terceros en nuestro sitio web.

 

Si un interesado accede a nuestro sitio web a través de un anuncio de Google, Google almacena una denominada cookie de conversión en el sistema informático del interesado. Lo que son las cookies ya se ha explicado anteriormente. Una cookie de conversión pierde su validez después de treinta días y no se utiliza para identificar al interesado. La cookie de conversión se utiliza para rastrear si determinadas subpáginas, por ejemplo el carrito de la compra de un sistema de tienda online, han sido llamadas en nuestro sitio web, siempre que la cookie no haya caducado todavía. A través de la cookie de conversión, tanto nosotros como Google podemos rastrear si un sujeto de datos que llegó a nuestro sitio web a través de un anuncio de AdWords generó una venta, es decir, completó o canceló una compra de bienes.

 

Los datos y la información recopilados mediante el uso de la cookie de conversión son utilizados por Google para elaborar estadísticas de visitas a nuestro sitio web. A su vez, estas estadísticas de visitas son utilizadas por nosotros para determinar el número total de usuarios que fueron remitidos a nosotros a través de los anuncios de AdWords, es decir, para determinar el éxito o el fracaso del respectivo anuncio de AdWords y para optimizar nuestros anuncios de AdWords para el futuro. Ni nuestra empresa ni otros anunciantes de Google AdWords reciben información de Google mediante la cual se podría identificar al interesado.

Mediante la cookie de conversión se almacena información personal, por ejemplo, las páginas de Internet visitadas por el interesado. Cada vez que el interesado visita nuestro sitio web, los datos personales, incluida la dirección IP de la conexión a Internet utilizada por el interesado, se transmiten a Google en los Estados Unidos de América. Estos datos personales son almacenados por Google en los Estados Unidos de América. Google puede revelar a terceros estos datos personales recogidos mediante el procedimiento técnico.

 

El interesado puede impedir en todo momento la instalación de cookies en nuestro sitio web, tal y como se ha descrito anteriormente, mediante una configuración adecuada del navegador de Internet utilizado y así oponerse de forma permanente a la instalación de cookies. Esta configuración del navegador de Internet utilizado también impedirá que Google instale una cookie de conversión en el sistema informático del interesado. Además, una cookie ya establecida por Google AdWords puede ser eliminada en cualquier momento a través del navegador de Internet u otros programas de software.

 

Además, el interesado tiene la opción de oponerse a la publicidad basada en intereses de Google. Para ello, el interesado debe acceder al enlace www.google.de/settings/ads desde cualquiera de los navegadores de Internet que utilice y realizar allí los ajustes deseados.

El controlador ha integrado componentes de Twitter en este sitio web. Twitter es un servicio de microblogging multilingüe de acceso público en el que los usuarios pueden publicar y difundir los llamados tweets, es decir, mensajes cortos limitados a 280 caracteres. Cualquier persona puede acceder a estos mensajes cortos, incluso quienes no están registrados en Twitter. Sin embargo, los tweets también se muestran a los llamados seguidores del usuario respectivo. Los seguidores son otros usuarios de Twitter que siguen los tweets de un usuario. Además, Twitter permite dirigirse a una amplia audiencia mediante hashtags, enlaces o retweets.

 

La empresa operadora de Twitter es Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.

#### 21. Método de pago: Política de privacidad de Payone como método de pago con tarjeta de crédito #### 

Si decide pagar su viaje con tarjeta de crédito, sus datos personales se transmitirán a Payone. La base legal para la transmisión de los datos es el artículo 6 (1) a del GDPR (consentimiento) y el artículo 6 (1) b del GDPR (tratamiento para la ejecución de un contrato) de PAYONE GmbH, Lyoner Straße 9, 60528 Frankfurt am Main, Alemania. Correo electrónico: privacy@payone.com

 

Con el pago con tarjeta de crédito, usted consiente la transmisión de sus datos personales, como el nombre, la dirección de correo electrónico y los datos de la tarjeta de crédito, a Payone. El resto de los datos recogidos por Payone pueden consultarse en su política de privacidad:

[https://docs.payone.com/display/public/PLATFORM/Privacy+Policy](https://docs.payone.com/display/public/PLATFORM/Privacy+Policy) 

#### 22. Base legales del tratamiento #### 

El artículo 6 I lit. a del GDPR sirve de base jurídica a nuestra empresa para las operaciones de tratamiento en las que obtenemos el consentimiento para una finalidad de tratamiento específica. Si el tratamiento de los datos personales es necesario para la ejecución de un contrato en el que el interesado es parte, como es el caso, por ejemplo, de las operaciones de tratamiento que son necesarias para una entrega de bienes o la prestación de otro servicio o contraprestación, el tratamiento se basa en el Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. Lo mismo se aplica a las operaciones de procesamiento que son necesarias para la aplicación de medidas precontractuales, por ejemplo en los casos de consultas sobre nuestros productos o servicios. Si nuestra empresa está sujeta a una obligación legal por la que se hace necesario un tratamiento de datos personales, como por ejemplo para el cumplimiento de las obligaciones fiscales, el tratamiento se basa en el Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. En raras ocasiones, el tratamiento de datos personales podría ser necesario para proteger los intereses vitales del interesado o de otra persona física. Este sería el caso, por ejemplo, si un visitante se lesionase en nuestras instalaciones y, como resultado, su nombre, edad, datos del seguro de enfermedad u otra información vital tuviese que ser transmitida a un médico, hospital u otro tercero. En ese caso, el tratamiento se basaría en el art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Por último, las operaciones de tratamiento podrían basarse en el Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. 

 

Las operaciones de procesamiento que no están cubiertas por ninguna de las bases legales mencionadas se basan en esta base legal si el procesamiento es necesario para proteger un interés legítimo de nuestra empresa o de un tercero, siempre que no se anulen los intereses, los derechos y las libertades fundamentales del sujeto de los datos. Estas operaciones de tratamiento nos están permitidas, en particular, porque fueron mencionadas específicamente por el legislador europeo. A este respecto, consideró que podía suponerse un interés legítimo si el interesado es cliente del responsable del tratamiento (considerando 47, frase 2 del GDPR).

#### 23. Intereses legítimos en el tratamiento que persigue el responsable del tratamiento o un tercero #### 

Si el tratamiento de los datos personales se basa en el artículo 6 I lit. f del GDPR, nuestro interés legítimo es el desempeño de nuestras actividades comerciales en beneficio del bienestar de todos nuestros empleados y nuestros accionistas.

#### 24. Duración de la conservación de los datos personales #### 

El criterio para la duración del almacenamiento de los datos personales es el respectivo período de conservación legal. Una vez transcurrido el periodo, los datos correspondientes se eliminarán de forma rutinaria, siempre que ya no sean necesarios para la ejecución del contrato o el inicio del mismo.

#### 25. Requisitos legales o contractuales para el suministro de datos personales; necesidad para la celebración del contrato; obligación del interesado de proporcionar los datos personales; posibles consecuencias de no proporcionar los datos #### 

Le informamos de que el suministro de datos personales es a veces requerido por la ley (por ejemplo, normas fiscales) o también puede resultar de las normas contractuales (por ejemplo, información sobre el socio contractual). En ocasiones, para la celebración de un contrato, puede ser necesario que el interesado nos facilite datos personales que posteriormente deban ser tratados por nosotros. Por ejemplo, el interesado está obligado a proporcionarnos datos personales si nuestra empresa celebra un contrato con él. Si no se facilitan los datos personales, el contrato con el interesado no podrá celebrarse. Antes de facilitar los datos personales por parte del interesado, éste debe ponerse en contacto con uno de nuestros empleados. Nuestro empleado informará al interesado, caso por caso, de si el suministro de los datos personales es requerido por la ley o el contrato o es necesario para la celebración del contrato, si existe la obligación de proporcionar los datos personales y cuáles serían las consecuencias de no proporcionarlos.

#### 26. Procesadores de pedidos #### 

Utilizamos proveedores de servicios externos (procesadores de pedidos), por ejemplo, para el envío de boletines informativos, la tramitación de pagos con tarjeta de crédito o los programas de viajes. Para garantizar la protección de sus datos personales, se ha celebrado un acuerdo de procesamiento de datos de pedidos con el proveedor de servicios.

 

Si desea conocer los proveedores de servicios con los que trabajamos, puede solicitarnos una lista. Para ello, envíenos un correo electrónico a privacidad@venturatravel.org, y le enviaremos la información solicitada.

#### 27. Descargo de responsabilidad #### 

A pesar del cuidadoso control de los contenidos, no asumimos ninguna responsabilidad por todos los enlaces externos de nuestro sitio web. En el momento de establecer el enlace, no se apreciaba ningún contenido ilegal en las páginas externas. Sin embargo, como no tenemos ninguna influencia en el diseño actual y futuro de las páginas externas, nos distanciamos expresamente de su contenido.

#### 28. Existencia de la toma de decisiones automatizada #### 

Como empresa responsable, no utilizamos la toma de decisiones automatizada ni la elaboración de perfiles.

Esta declaración de protección de datos ha sido elaborada por el generador de la declaración de protección de datos de DGD Deutsche Gesellschaft für Datenschutz GmbH, que actúa como responsable externo de la protección de datos de Dachau, en colaboración con el abogado de la ley de protección de datos Christian Solmecke.

Deze verklaring verwijst naar de verzameling, de verwerking en het gebruik van uw persoonsgegevens. Persoonsgegevens bevatten uw naam en adres, uw e-mail- en Ip-adres en ook gebruiksgegevens die aan u kunnen worden toegewezen.
De verwerking van persoonsgegevens, zoals naam, adres, e-mailadres of telefoonnummer van een gegevenssubject, zullen altijd in overeenstemming zijn met de landspecifieke regelgevingen inzake gegevensbescherming die van toepassing zijn op Ventura TRAVEL GmbH. Door middel van deze verklaring inzake gegevensbescherming wil ons bedrijf het publiek informeren over de aard, de omvang en het doel van de persoonsgegevens die we verzamelen, gebruiken en verwerken. Daarnaast worden gegevenssubjecten geïnformeerd over hun rechten via deze verklaring inzake gegevensbescherming.
Als supervisor heeft Ventura TRAVEL GmbH verschillende technische en organisatorische maatregelen geïmplementeerd om te garanderen dat de persoonsgegevens die op deze website worden verwerkt, zo goed mogelijk worden beschermd. Niettemin kan de beveiliging van gegevensoverdrachten op internet kwetsbaarheden vertonen, waardoor een absolute beveiliging niet kan worden gegarandeerd.
Daarom kan elk gegevenssubject ons persoonsgegevens op een alternatieve manier verzenden, bijvoorbeeld telefonisch.

#### 1. Definities van termen
De verklaring inzake gegevensbescherming van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH is gebaseerd op de termen die worden gebruikt in de Europese richtlijn en door de handhaver van de verordening bij het publiceren van de Algemene verordening inzake gegevensbescherming (GDPR). Ons privacybeleid moet gemakkelijk te lezen en te begrijpen zijn voor het publiek, alsook voor onze klanten en zakenpartners. Om dit te garanderen, willen we eerst de gebruikte terminologie verklaren.
In dit privacybeleid gebruiken we onder andere de volgende termen:
a) Persoonsgegevens
Persoonsgegevens is alle informatie over een geïdentificeerd of identificeerbaar natuurlijk persoon (hierna "gegevenssubject"). Een identificeerbaar natuurlijk persoon is een persoon die direct of indirect kan worden geïdentificeerd, in het bijzonder door naar een identificator te verwijzen zoals een naam, een ID-nummer, locatiegegevens, een online identificator or naar een of meerdere factoren specifiek aan de fysieke, fysiologische, genetische, mentale, economische, culturele of sociale identiteit van die natuurlijke persoon.
b) Gegevenssubject
Gegevenssubject betekent elk geïdentificeerd of identificeerbaar natuurlijk persoon waarvan de persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt door de supervisor.
c) Verwerking
Verwerking betekent elke actie of reeks acties die wordt uitgevoerd voor persoonsgegevens, al dan niet op automatische wijze, zoals het verzamelen, opnemen, organiseren, archiveren, opslaan, aanpassen of wijzigen, verkrijgen, raadplegen, gebruiken, bekendmaken door toezending, verspreiden of op andere wijze beschikbaar maken, afstemmen of combineren, beperken, wissen of vernietigen ervan.
d) Beperking van de verwerking
Beperking van de verwerking is het markeren van opgeslagen persoonsgegevens met als doel de verdere verwerking ervan te beperken.
e) Profilering
Profilering is elk type geautomatiseerde verwerking van persoonsgegevens waarbij die persoonsgegevens worden gebruikt om bepaalde persoonlijke aspecten te evalueren van een natuurlijke persoon, in het bijzonder om bepaalde aspecten te analyseren of te voorspellen over de prestaties op het werk van die natuurlijke persoon, zijn economische situatie, gezondheid, persoonlijke voorkeuren, interesses, betrouwbaarheid, gedrag, locatie of wijziging van locatie.
f) Pseudonimisering
Pseudonimisering is het verwerken van persoonsgegevens op een manier waarbij die persoonsgegevens niet meer kunnen worden toegewezen aan een gegevenssubject zonder daarbij aanvullende informatie te gebruiken, op voorwaarde dat die aanvullende informatie apart wordt gehouden en onderhevig is aan technische en organisatorische maatregelen om te garanderen dat de persoonsgegevens niet zijn toegewezen aan een geïdentificeerde of identificeerbare natuurlijke persoon. 
g) Beheerder of gegevensbeheerder
De beheerder of de persoon die verantwoordelijk is voor de verwerking is de natuurlijke of rechtspersoon, openbare autoriteit, het agentschap of een andere instantie die alleen of samen met anderen de doelen van en de middelen voor de verwerking van de persoonsgegevens bepaalt. Indien de doelen van en de middelen voor zo een verwerking worden bepaald door de wetgeving van de Unie of de lidstaten, kunnen de beheerder of de specifieke criteria voor zijn aanwijzing worden vastgesteld door de wetgeving van de Unie of de lidstaat.
h) Verwerker
Een verwerker is een natuurlijke of rechtspersoon, openbare autoriteit, agentschap of andere instantie die persoonsgegevens verwerkt in naam van de beheerder.
i) Ontvanger
Een ontvanger is een natuurlijke of rechtspersoon, openbare autoriteit, agentschap of andere instantie waaraan persoonsgegevens worden verstrekt, en is al dan niet een derde partij. Openbare autoriteiten die mogelijk persoonsgegevens ontvangen in de context van een specifieke onderzoekstaak onder de wetgeving van de Unie of de lidstaat zullen echter niet worden beschouwd als ontvangers. 
j) Derde partij
Een derde partij is een natuurlijke of rechtspersoon, openbare autoriteit, agentschap of andere instantie die niet het gegevenssubject, de beheerder, de verwerker of de persoon is die gemachtigd is om de persoonsgegevens te verwerken onder de directe verantwoordelijkheid van de beheerder of de verwerker.
k) Toestemming
Toestemming betekent elke vrijwillig gegeven indicatie van de wens van het gegevenssubject voor het specifieke geval op een geïnformeerde en ondubbelzinnige manier, in de vorm van een verklaring of eender welke andere ondubbelzinnige bevestigende actie waarbij het gegevenssubject aangeeft dat hij of zij instemt met de verwerking van persoonsgegevens van hem of haar.

#### 4. Cookies en andere trackingtechnologieën
De internetpagina’s van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH gebruiken cookies en andere trackingtechnologieën (zoals HTML5 Local Storage). Cookies zijn tekstbestanden die worden opgeslagen op een computersysteem via een internetbrowser.
Verschillende internetsites en servers maken gebruik van cookies. Veel cookies hebben een zogenaamd cookie-ID. Een cookie-ID is een unieke identificator van de cookie. Deze bestaat uit een reeks tekens waarmee internetpagina’s en servers kunnen worden toegewezen aan de specifieke internetbrowser waarin de cookie was opgeslagen. Op die manier kunnen de bezochte internetpagina’s en servers de browser van het gegevenssubject onderscheiden van andere browsers die andere cookies bevatten. Een specifieke internetbrowser kan worden herkend en geïdentificeerd via het unieke cookie-ID.
Door gebruik te maken van cookies, kan Ventura TRAVEL GmbH de gebruikers van deze website een meer gebruiksvriendelijke service bieden, wat niet mogelijk zou zijn zonder deze cookie-instelling.
Door middel van deze cookie kunnen de informatie en aanbiedingen op onze website worden geoptimaliseerd voor de gebruiker. Zoals eerder vermeld kunnen we door cookies de gebruikers van onze website herkennen. Het doel daarvan is het gebruik van onze website gemakkelijker te maken. Zo hoeft de gebruiker van een website die cookies gebruikt bijvoorbeeld niet telkens zijn of haar toegangsgegevens in te voeren wanneer hij of zij de website bezoekt, omdat dit al wordt gedaan door de website en de cookie die is opgeslagen op het computersysteem van de gebruiker. Een ander voorbeeld is de cookie van een winkelwagentje in een online winkel. Door middel van een cookie onthoudt de online winkel de items die een klant in het virtuele winkelwagentje heeft gelegd.
Het gegevenssubject kan op eender welk moment voorkomen dat er door onze website cookies worden geplaatst door dat zo in te stellen in de internetbrowser die wordt gebruikt, en dus permanent te weigeren dat er cookies worden geplaatst. Daarnaast kunnen cookies die al zijn geplaatst op eender welk moment worden gewist via een internetbrowser of andere softwareprogramma's. Dit is mogelijk in alle gewone internetbrowsers. Indien het gegevenssubject het plaatsen van cookies in de gebruikte internetbrowser deactiveert, is het mogelijk dat niet alle functies van onze website volledig kunnen worden gebruikt.
#### 5. Verzamelen van algemene gegevens en informatie
De website van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH verzamelt een reeks algemene gegevens en informatie telkens de website wordt opgeroepen door een gegevenssubject of een geautomatiseerd systeem. Deze algemene gegevens en informatie worden opgeslagen in de logbestanden van de server. De volgende gegevens worden mogelijk verzameld: (1) de browsertypes en gebruikte versies, (2) het door het toegang verkrijgende gebruikte besturingssysteem, (3) de website die het toegang verkrijgende systeem gebruikt om onze website te openen (zogenaamde referrer), (4) de subwebsites die worden geopend via een toegang verkrijgend systeem op onze website, (5) de datum en het tijdstip van toegang tot de website, (6) een internetprotocoladres (IP-adres), (7) de internetserviceprovider van het toegang verkrijgende systeem en (8) andere gelijkaardige data en informatie die dienen om gevaar te voorkomen in geval van aanvallen op onze informatietechnologiesystemen.
Wanneer deze algemene gegevens en informatie worden gebruikt, trekt Ventura TRAVEL GmbH geen conclusies over het gegevenssubject. Deze informatie is echter nodig (1) om de inhoud van onze website correct weer te geven, (2) om de inhoud van onze website en de promotie ervan te optimaliseren, (3) om te garanderen dat onze informatietechnologiesystemen en de technologie van onze website correct blijven werken, en (4) om wetshandhavingsinstanties de informatie te bieden die nodig is voor vervolging in geval van een cyberaanval. Daartoe analyseert Ventura TRAVEL GmbH op anonieme wijze de verzamelde gegevens en informatie, en tracht het ook de voor een betere gegevensbeveiliging en veiligheid van gegevens van ons bedrijf te zorgen, zodat we een optimaal beschermingsniveau kunnen garanderen voor de persoonsgegevens die we verwerken. De anonieme gegevens van de logbestanden van de server worden apart opgeslagen van alle door een gegevenssubject verstrekte persoonsgegevens.
#### 6. Registratie op onze website
Het gegevenssubject heeft de mogelijkheid om zich te registreren op de website van de beheerder door persoonsgegevens te verstrekken. Welke persoonsgegevens tijdens dit proces worden verzonden naar de beheerder, wordt bepaald op basis van het invoermasker dat wordt gebruikt voor de registratie. De door het gegevenssubject ingevoerde persoonsgegevens worden uitzonderlijk verzameld en opgeslagen voor intern gebruik door de beheerder en voor diens eigen doeleinden. De beheerder kan ervoor zorgen dat de gegevens worden verzonden naar een of meer verwerkers, bijvoorbeeld een pakketdienstverlener, die de persoonsgegevens ook uitsluitend zal gebruiken voor een intern gebruik dat is toegewezen aan de beheerder.
Door te registreren op de website van de beheerder, worden ook het IP-adres dat is toegewezen door de internetserviceprovider (ISP) van het gegevenssubject, de gegevens en het tijdstip van de registratie opgeslagen. Deze gegevens worden opgeslagen omdat alleen op deze manier het misbruiken van onze services kan worden voorkomen en deze gegevens het indien nodig mogelijk maken om begane misdaden op te helderen. Daarom is het nodig deze gegevens op te slaan om de gegevensbeheerder te beschermen. In principe worden deze gegevens niet doorgegeven aan derde partijen, tenzij er een wettelijke verplichting is om deze door te geven of het doorgeven van deze gegevens dient voor criminele vervolging.
Indien het gegevenssubject zich registreert door vrijwillig persoonsgegevens te verstrekken, kan de beheerder het gegevenssubject content of services bieden die door de aard daarvan alleen kunnen worden aangeboden aan geregistreerde gebruikers. Geregistreerde personen kunnen de tijdens de registratie verstrekte persoonsgegevens op eender welk moment wijzigen of kunnen deze volledig laten verwijderen uit het gegevensbestand van de beheerder.
De beheerder zal elk gegevenssubject op eender welk moment en op verzoek informatie verstrekken over welke persoonsgegevens van het gegevenssubject worden opgeslagen. Daarnaast zal de beheerder op verzoek of op aangeven van het gegevenssubject persoonsgegevens corrigeren of verwijderen, op voorwaarde dat dit niet in strijd is met enige wettelijke bewaarplichten. Het voltallige personeel van de beheerder zal in deze context beschikbaar zijn als contactpersoon van het gegevenssubject.
#### 7. Inschrijving voor onze nieuwsbrief
Op de website van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH hebben gebruikers de mogelijkheid om zich in te schrijven voor de nieuwsbrief van ons bedrijf. De persoonsgegevens die naar de beheerder worden verzonden wanneer de gebruiker zich inschrijft voor onze nieuwsbrief, zullen worden vermeld in het hiervoor gebruikte invoermasker. Ventura TRAVEL GmbH informeert zijn klanten en zakenpartners regelmatig via een nieuwsbrief over aanbiedingen van het bedrijf. De nieuwsbrief van ons bedrijf kan eigenlijk alleen door het gegevenssubject worden ontvangen indien (1) het gegevenssubject een geldig e-mailadres heeft en (2) het gegevenssubject zich registreert voor het ontvangen van mails met de nieuwsbrief. Om wettelijke redenen zal er een bevestigingse-mail worden verzonden naar het e-mailadres dat de eerste keer door een gegevenssubject is ingevoerd voor het verzenden van de nieuwsbrief door middel van de dubbele opt-inprocedure. Deze bevestigingse-mail dient om te controleren of de eigenaar van het e-mailadres het gegevenssubject is dat toestemming heeft gegeven voor het ontvangen van de nieuwsbrief.
Wanneer iemand zich registreert voor de nieuwsbrief, slaan we ook het IP-adres op van het computersysteem dat door het gegevenssubject wordt gebruikt op het moment van de registratie, zoals het is toegewezen door de internetserviceprovider (ISP), alsook de datum en het tijdstip van de registratie. Het verzamelen van deze gegevens is nodig om een (mogelijk) misbruik van een e-mailadres van een gegevenssubject op een later moment op te sporen, het dient dus als wettelijke bescherming van de beheerder.
De in de context van een registratie voor de nieuwsbrief verzamelde persoonsgegevens worden uitsluitend gebruikt voor het verzenden van onze nieuwsbrief. Daarnaast kunnen personen die zich hebben geregistreerd voor de nieuwsbrief per e-mail worden geïnformeerd indien dit noodzakelijk is voor de werking van de nieuwsbriefdienst of een verwante registratie, zoals het geval kan zijn bij wijzigingen van het nieuwsbriefaanbod of gewijzigde technische omstandigheden. Persoonsgegevens die zijn verzameld als deel van de nieuwsbriefdienst zullen niet worden doorgegeven aan derde partijen. De inschrijving voor onze nieuwsbrief kan op eender welk moment worden geannuleerd door het gegevenssubject. De toestemming voor de opslag van persoonsgegevens die het gegevenssubject aan ons heeft gegeven voor het mailen van de nieuwsbrief kan op eender welk moment worden ingetrokken. De link voor het intrekken van de toestemming staat in elke nieuwsbrief. Daarnaast is het ook mogelijk zich uit te schrijven voor de nieuwsbrief door op eender welk moment direct een mail te sturen op de website van de beheerder of door de beheerder daarvan op een andere manier op de hoogte te brengen.
#### 8. Nieuwsbrieftracking
De nieuwsbrieven van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH bevatten zogenaamde trackingpixels. Een trackingpixel is een miniatuurgrafiek die worden ingevoegd in zulke e-mails die in HTML-formaat worden verzonden zodat logbestanden kunnen worden gearchiveerd en geanalyseerd. Hierdoor kunnen statistische evaluaties worden gemaakt van het al dan niet slagen van marketingcampagnes. Op basis van de ingevoegde trackingpixel kan Ventura TRAVEL GmbH zien of en wanneer een e-mail was geopend door een gegevenssubject en op welke links in de e-mail het gegevenssubject heeft geklikt.
Zulke persoonsgegevens die via de trackingpixels in de nieuwsbrieven werden verzameld, worden opgeslagen en geanalyseerd door de beheerder om het verzenden van de nieuwsbrief te optimaliseren en om de inhoud van toekomstige nieuwsbrieven beter af te stemmen op de interesses van het gegevenssubject. Deze persoonsgegevens zullen niet worden verstrekt aan derde partijen. Gegevenssubjecten hebben op eender welk moment het recht om de hiervoor afzonderlijk gegeven toestemming in te trekken via de dubbele opt-inprocedure. Na deze intrekking worden de persoonsgegevens verwijderd door de beheerder. Ventura TRAVEL GmbH beschouwt een opzegging van de ontvangst van de nieuwsbrief automatisch als een herroeping.
#### 9. Contactmogelijkheid via de website
Op basis van wettelijke bepalingen bevat de website van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH informatie die snel elektronisch contact met ons bedrijf mogelijk maakt, evenals directe communicatie met ons, wat ook een algemeen adres omvat van de zogenaamde elektronische mail (e-mailadres). Indien een gegevenssubject via e-mail, door middel van een contactformulier of door middel van een chatfunctie contact opneemt met de beheerder, zullen de door het gegevenssubject verzonden persoonsgegevens automatisch worden opgeslagen. Zulke vrijwillig door een gegevenssubject naar de beheerder verzonden persoonsgegevens zullen worden opgeslagen voor verwerkingsdoeleinden of om contact op te nemen met het gegevenssubject. Deze persoonsgegevens zullen niet worden verstrekt aan derde partijen.
#### 10. Commentaarfunctie in de blog op de website
Ventura TRAVEL GmbH biedt de gebruikers de mogelijkheid om individuele commentaren te geven op afzonderlijke blogposts van een blog, die op de website van de beheerder staat. Een blog is een portaal dat wordt beheerd op een website, meestal openbaar, waarop een of meerdere personen, zogenaamde bloggers of webbloggers, artikels kunnen posten of een tekst kunnen schrijven in zogenaamde blogposts. Op de blogposts kan meestal commentaar worden gegeven door derde partijen.
Indien een gegevenssubject commentaar geeft op een blog die gepubliceerd is op deze website, zal naast de commentaar van het gegevenssubject informatie over het tijdstip van de commentaar en de door het gegevenssubject gekozen gebruikersnaam (pseudoniem) worden opgeslagen en gepubliceerd. Daarnaast wordt ook het door de internetserviceprovider (ISP) toegewezen IP-adres van de betroffen persoon opgeslagen. Dit IP-adres wordt opgeslagen om veiligheidsredenen en voor het geval het gegevenssubject de rechten van derde partijen schendt door een commentaar of posts met illegale content te posten. Het opslaan van deze persoonsgegevens is daarom in het eigen belang van de beheerder, zodat de beheerder zich kan vrijpleiten in geval van een inbreuk. Deze verzamelde persoonsgegevens worden niet verstrekt aan derde partijen, tenzij het wettelijk vereist is om deze te verstrekken of het dient voor de wettelijke verdediging van de beheerder.
#### 11. Registratie voor commentaren in de blog op de internetsite
Over het algemeen kunnen derde partijen zich registreren voor commentaren op de blog van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH. Voor iemand die commentaar geeft is het met name mogelijk om zich te registreren voor de commentaren die na zijn of haar commentaar komen op een specifieke blogpost.
Indien een gegevenssubject de optie aanvinkt om zich te registreren voor commentaren, zal de beheerder een automatische bevestigingse-mail zenden om door middel van een dubbele opt-inprocedure te controleren of de eigenaar van het gespecificeerde e-mailadres werkelijk voor deze optie heeft gekozen. De optie om zich te registreren voor commentaren kan op elk moment worden gedeactiveerd.
#### 12. Routinematig wissen en blokkeren van persoonsgegevens
De beheerder mag persoonsgegevens van het gegevenssubject enkel verwerken en opslaan voor die periode die noodzakelijk is voor om het doel van die opslag te verwezenlijken of voor die periode die is vastgesteld door de wetgever van de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving of door een andere wetgever voor wetten en regelgevingen waaraan de beheerder onderhevig is.
Indien het doel van de opslag niet meer van toepassing is of indien een opslagduur die is vastgesteld door de opsteller van de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving of een andere competente wetgever vervalt, zullen de persoonsgegevens routinematig worden verwijderd of geblokkeerd in overeenstemming met de wettelijke bepalingen.
#### 13. Rechten van het gegevenssubject
a) Recht op bevestiging
Aan elk gegevenssubject is volgens de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om een bevestiging te krijgen van de beheerder of er van hem of haar al dan niet persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt.

b) Recht op toegang
Aan elke persoon waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, wordt volgens de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om op elk moment en gratis van de beheerder informatie te krijgen over de persoonsgegevens die van hem of haar zijn opgeslagen en om een kopie van deze informatie te krijgen. Daarnaast heeft de wetgever voor de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het gegevenssubject toegang verleend tot de volgende informatie:

indien de persoonsgegevens niet worden verzameld van het gegevenssubject: Alle beschikbare informatie over de herkomst van de gegevens
Het bestaan van het geautomatiseerd maken van beslissingen, inclusief profilering, krachtens Artikel 22(1) en (4) van de GDPR en, ten minste in deze gevallen, betekenisvolle informatie over de toegepaste logica en de omvang en de bedoelde effecten van zo een verwerking voor het gegevenssubject. Daarnaast zal het gegevenssubject het recht hebben om geïnformeerd te worden of de persoonsgegevens zijn verzonden naar een ander land of naar een internationale organisatie. Indien dit het geval is, heeft het gegevenssubject ook het recht om informatie te krijgen over de passende waarborgen in verband met de overdracht.
Indien een gegevenssubject dit recht op toegang wil uitoefenen, kan hij of zij op eender welk moment contact opnemen met een werknemer van de beheerder.
c) Recht op rectificatie
Aan elke persoon waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, wordt door de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om de onmiddellijke correctie van incorrecte persoonsgegevens van hem of haar te verzoeken.

Indien een gegevenssubject dit recht op rectificatie wil uitoefenen, kan hij of zij op eender welk moment contact opnemen met een werknemer van de beheerder.
d) Recht op verwijdering (recht om vergeten te worden)
Aan elke persoon waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, wordt door de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om zonder vertraging zijn of haar persoonsgegevens door de beheerder te laten wissen, indien een van de volgende redenen van toepassing is en de verwerking niet langer nodig is:
De persoonsgegevens worden verzameld of op andere wijze verwerkt voor doeleinden waarvoor ze niet langer benodigd zijn.
Het gegevenssubject herroept zijn of haar toestemming waarop de verwerking was gebaseerd krachtens  Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR of Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR en er is geen andere wettelijke basis voor de verwerking.
Het gegevenssubject maakt bezwaar tegen de verwerking krachtens Artikel 21(1) GDPR en er zijn geen dwingende legitieme redenen voor de verwerking, of het gegevenssubject maakt bezwaar tegen de verwerking krachtens Artikel 21(2) GDPR.
De persoonsgegevens zijn onwettig verwerkt.
Het wissen van de persoonsgegevens is noodzakelijk om te voldoen aan een wettelijke verplichting volgens de wetgeving van de Unie of een lidstaat waaraan de beheerder onderworpen is.
De persoonsgegevens zijn verzameld in verband met de aangeboden diensten van de informatiemaatschappij krachtens Artikel 8(1) GDPR.
Indien een van de eerder vermelde redenen van toepassing is en een gegevenssubject de persoonsgegevens wil laten wissen die zijn opgeslagen door Ventura TRAVEL GmbH, kan hij of zij op eender welk moment contact opnemen met een werknemer van de beheerder. De werknemer van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH zal ervoor zorgen dat het verzoek om deze te wissen onmiddellijk wordt uitgevoerd.
Indien de persoonsgegevens openbaar werden gemaakt door Ventura TRAVEL GmbH en ons bedrijf daar verantwoordelijk voor is krachtens Art. 17 Para. 1 GDPR, zal Ventura TRAVEL GmbH redelijke maatregelen implementeren, inclusief technische maatregelen, om andere gegevensbeheerders te compenseren voor het verwerken van de gepubliceerde persoonsgegevens, waarbij rekening wordt gehouden met de beschikbare technologie en de kosten voor die implementatie, zodat het gegevenssubject kan worden geïnformeerd dat hij of zij aan deze andere gegevensbeheerders heeft gevraagd alle links naar de persoonsgegevens of kopieën of replicaties van de persoonsgegevens te verwijderen, tenzij de verwerking noodzakelijk is. De werknemer van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH zal voor al het nodige zorgen in afzonderlijke gevallen.
e) Recht op beperking van verwerking
Aan elke persoon waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, wordt door de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om de beheerder de verwerking van de persoonsgegevens te laten beperken indien aan een van de volgende voorwaarden is voldaan:
De accuraatheid van de persoonsgegevens wordt aangekaart door het gegevenssubject voor een periode die de beheerder in staat stelt de accuraatheid van de persoonsgegevens te controleren.
De verwerking is onwettig, het gegevenssubject maakt bezwaar tegen de verwijdering van de persoonsgegevens en vraagt in plaats daarvan het gebruik van de persoonsgegevens te beperken.
De beheerder heeft de persoonsgegevens niet langer nodig voor de doelen van de verwerking, maar het gegevenssubject heeft deze nodig voor het doen gelden, het uitoefenen of het verdedigen van rechtsvorderingen.
Het gegevenssubject heeft bezwaar gemaakt tegen de verwerking krachtens Artikel 21 (1) van de GDPR en het is nog niet duidelijk of de rechtsgronden van de beheerder zwaarder doorwegen dan die van het gegevenssubject.
Indien aan een van de eerder vermelde voorwaarden is voldaan en een gegevenssubject de persoonsgegevens wil laten beperken die zijn opgeslagen door Ventura TRAVEL GmbH, kan hij of zij op eender welk moment contact opnemen met een werknemer van de beheerder. De werknemer van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH zal ervoor zorgen dat de verwerking wordt beperkt.
f) Recht op overdraagbaarheid van gegevens
Aan elke persoon waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt is door de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om de persoonsgegevens van hem of haar te ontvangen die door het gegevenssubject zijn verstrekt aan een beheerder, en dit op een gestructureerde, algemeen gebruikte en door een machine leesbaar formaat. Hij of zij heeft ook het recht om zulke gegevens te verzenden naar een andere beheerder zonder belemmering van de beheerder waaraan de persoonsgegevens worden verstrekt, op voorwaarde dat de verwerking is gebaseerd op toestemming krachtens Artikel 6(1)(a) van de GDPR of Artikel 9(2)(a) van de GDPR of een contract krachtens Artikel 6(1)(b) van de GDPR en de verwerking op automatische wijze wordt uitgevoerd, tenzij de verwerking noodzakelijk is voor het uitvoeren van een taak die wordt verricht in het openbare belang of bij de uitoefening van het openbaar gezag dat aan de beheerder is opgedragen.
Daarnaast zal het gegevenssubject bij het uitoefenen van het recht op de overdracht van gegevens krachtens Artikel 20(1) van de GDPR het recht hebben de persoonsgegevens direct te laten overdragen van een beheerder naar een andere beheerder waar dat technisch mogelijk is en op voorwaarde dat dit geen negatief effect heeft op de rechten en vrijheden van andere individuen. Om het recht op gegevensoverdracht te doen gelden, kan het gegevenssubject op eender welk moment contact opnemen met een werknemer van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH.
g) Recht op bezwaar
Aan elke persoon waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt heeft de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om op eender welk moment bezwaar te maken, om redenen die betrekking hebben op zijn of haar persoonlijke situatie, tegen de verwerking van persoonsgegevens van hem of haar, wat gebeurt op basis van Artikel 6(1)(e) of (f) van de GDPR. Dit is ook van toepassing voor profilering op basis van deze bepalingen.
Ventura TRAVEL GmbH zal in het geval van een bezwaar niet langer persoonsgegevens verwerken, tenzij we dwingende legitimerende gronden voor de verwerking kunnen aantonen die zwaarder doorwegen dan de belangen, rechten en vrijheden van het gegevenssubject, of voor het doen gelden, uitoefenen of verdedigen van rechtsclaims.
Indien Ventura TRAVEL GmbH persoonsgegevens verwerkt voor directe marketing, zal het gegevenssubject het recht hebben om op eender welk moment bezwaar te maken tegen de verwerking van persoonsgegevens die voor zulke marketing worden verwerkt. Dit is ook van toepassing op profilering, in zoverre dat van toepassing is op zulke directe marketing. Indien het gegevenssubject tegenover Ventura TRAVEL GmbH bezwaar maakt tegen de verwerking voor directe marketing, zal Ventura TRAVEL GmbH de persoonsgegevens niet langer verwerken voor deze doeleinden.
Daarnaast heeft het gegevenssubject het recht om redenen die betrekking hebben op zijn of haar specifieke situatie bezwaar te maken tegen de verwerking van persoonsgegevens over hem of haar die wordt uitgevoerd door Ventura TRAVEL GmbH voor wetenschappelijk of historisch onderzoek, of om statistische doeleinden krachtens Artikel 89(1) van de GDPR, tenzij zo een verwerking noodzakelijk is voor het uitvoeren van een taak die wordt uitgevoerd in het openbare belang.
Om het recht op bezwaar uit te oefenen, kan het gegevenssubject rechtstreeks contact opnemen met een werknemer van Ventura TRAVEL GmbH of met een andere werknemer. Daarnaast is het gegevenssubject vrij om zijn/haar recht op bezwaar uit te oefenen door middel van geautomatiseerde procedures die gebruik maken van technische specificaties in combinatie met het gebruik van informatiemaatschappijen, niettegenstaande Richtlijn 2002/58/EC.
h) Geautomatiseerde beslissingen in afzonderlijke gevallen, inclusief profilering
Aan elk gegevenssubject waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt wordt door de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om niet te worden onderworpen aan een beslissing die uitsluitend is gebaseerd op automatische verwerking, inclusief profilering, wat legale effecten genereert voor hem of haar of op gelijkaardige wijze significant van invloed is op hem of haar, tenzij die beslissing (1) noodzakelijk is voor het aangaan van of het uitvoeren van een overeenkomst tussen het gegevenssubject en de beheerder, of (2) is toegestaan door de wetgeving van de Unie of de lidstaat waaraan de beheerder is onderworpen en er in die wet geschikte maatregelen staan om de rechten en vrijheden en legitieme belangen van het gegevenssubject te waarborgen, of (3) is gemaakt met de expliciete toestemming van het gegevenssubject.
Indien de beslissing (1) noodzakelijk is voor het aangaan van of het uitvoeren van een overeenkomst tussen het gegevenssubject en de gegevensbeheerder of (2) is gemaakt met de expliciete toestemming van de gegevensbeheerder, zal Ventura TRAVEL GmbH geschikte maatregelen implementeren om de rechten en vrijheden en de legitieme belangen van het gegevenssubject te waarborgen, die ten minste het recht omvatten om de betrokkenheid van het gegevenssubject te verkrijgen vanwege de beheerder, om zijn of haar standpunt duidelijk te maken en de beslissing aan te kaarten.
Indien het gegevenssubject de rechten wil uitoefenen met betrekking tot geautomatiseerde beslissingen, kan hij of zij op eender welk moment contact opnemen met een werknemer van de beheerder.
i) Recht om toestemming in te trekken volgens de wetgeving inzake gegevensbescherming
Aan elke persoon waarvan persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, wordt door de Europese richtlijn en regelgeving het recht verleend om op eender welk moment de toestemming in te trekken voor de verwerking van persoonsgegevens.
Indien het gegevenssubject het recht voor het intrekken van zijn of haar toestemming wil uitoefenen, kan hij of zij op eender welk moment contact opnemen met een werknemer van de beheerder.
#### 14. Gegevensbescherming tijdens sollicitaties en het sollicitatieproces
De beheerder verzamelt en verwerkt de persoonsgegevens van sollicitanten voor het behandelen van de sollicitatieprocedure. De verwerking kan ook elektronisch gebeuren. Dit is vooral het geval wanneer een sollicitant relevante sollicitatiedocumenten op elektronische wijze verzendt naar de beheerder, bijvoorbeeld via e-mail of via een webformulier op de website. Indien de beheerder een arbeidsovereenkomst sluit met een sollicitant, zullen de verzonden gegevens worden opgeslagen voor de verwerking van de arbeidsrelatie in overeenstemming met de wettelijke bepalingen. Indien de beheerder geen arbeidsovereenkomst sluit met de sollicitant, zullen de sollicitatiedocumenten automatisch worden verwijderd twee maanden na de melding van de beslissing om de sollicitant niet aan te nemen, op voorwaarde dat er geen andere legitieme belangen van de beheerder in strijd zijn met deze verwijdering. Een ander legitiem belang in deze zin is bijvoorbeeld ver verplichting om bewijsmateriaal te leveren in procedures in het kader van de Algemene Wet inzake Gelijke Behandeling (AGG).
#### 15. Privacybeleid inzake het gebruik en de toepassing van Facebook
De beheerder heeft componenten van het bedrijf Facebook geïntegreerd op deze website. Facebook is een sociaal medianetwerk.
Een sociaal netwerk is een sociale ontmoetingsplek op het internet, een online gemeenschap waarin gebruikers met elkaar kunnen communiceren en op elkaar kunnen reageren in een virtuele ruimte. Een sociaal netwerk kan dienen als platform voor het delen van meningen en ervaringen of maakt het de internetgemeenschap mogelijk persoonlijke of bedrijfsgerelateerde informatie te delen. Op Facebook kunnen gebruikers van het sociale netwerk onder andere privé profielen aanmaken, foto’s uploaden en netwerken via vriendschapsverzoeken.
De moedermaatschappij van Facebook is Facebook, Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. De beheerder van persoonsgegevens in het geval dat een gegevenssubject buiten de VS of Canada woont is Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ierland.
Telkens een van de afzonderlijke pagina’s van deze website die beheerd wordt door de gegevensbeheerder wordt opgeroepen waarin een Facebook-component (Facebookplug-in) is geïntegreerd, zal de internetbrowser op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject door de Facebook-component automatisch een voorstelling van de overeenkomstige Facebook-component downloaden van Facebook. Een volledig overzicht van alle Facebookplug-ins staat op https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=nl_NL. Binnen het bereik van deze technische procedure ontvangt Facebook informatie over welke specifieke subpagina van onze website wordt bezocht door het gegevenssubject.
Indien het gegevenssubject op hetzelfde moment is aangemeld bij Facebook, herkent Facebook welke specifieke subpagina van onze website het gegevenssubject aan het bezoeken is telkens het gegevenssubject onze website oproept, en dit zolang hij op onze website blijft. Deze informatie wordt verzameld door de Facebook-component en wordt door Facebook toegewezen aan het overeenkomstige Facebook-account van het gegevenssubject. Indien het gegevenssubject een van de Facebook-knoppen activeert die geïntegreerd zijn op onze website, bijvoorbeeld de "Vind ik leuk"-knop, of indien het gegevenssubject een commentaar post, koppelt Facebook deze informatie aan het persoonlijk Facebook-account van het gegevenssubject en slaat het deze persoonsgegevens op.
Facebook ontvangt de informatie dat het gegevenssubject onze website heeft bezocht altijd via de Facebook-component indien het gegevenssubject tegelijkertijd is aangemeld bij Facebook wanneer deze onze website bezoekt; dit gebeurt ongeacht of het gegevenssubject op de Facebook-component klikt. Indien het gegevenssubject wenst dat deze informatie niet verzonden wordt naar Facebook, kan hij of zij deze verzending voorkomen door zich af te melden van zijn of haar Facebook-account alvorens onze website te openen.
Het door Facebook gepubliceerde gegevensbeleid, dat geraadpleegd kan worden op https://nl-nl.facebook.com/about/privacy/, bevat informatie over het verzamelen, verwerken en gebruiken van persoonsgegevens door Facebook. Hierin wordt ook uitgelegd welke instellingsopties Facebook biedt om de privacy van het gegevenssubject te beschermen. Daarnaast zijn er verschillende toepassingen beschikbaar die het mogelijk maken het verzenden van gegevens naar Facebook te voorkomen. Zulke toepassingen kunnen door het gegevenssubject worden gebruikt om het verzenden van gegevens naar Facebook te voorkomen.
#### 16. Privacybeleid inzake het gebruik en de toepassing van Google Analytics (met anonimiseringsfunctie)
De beheerder heeft de Google Analytics-component (met anonimiseringsfunctie) geïntegreerd in deze website. Google Analytics is een webanalyseservice. Webanalyse is het verzamelen, samenstellen en evalueren van gegevens over het gedrag van bezoekers op de websites. Een webanalyseservice verzamelt onder andere gegevens over via welke website een gegevenssubject op de website is gekomen (zogenaamde referrers), welke subpagina's van de website werden geopend of hoe vaak en hoe lang een subpagina werd bekeken. Een webanalyse wordt hoofdzakelijk gebruikt voor het optimaliseren van een website en voor de kosten-batenanalyse van internetadvertenties. Het moederbedrijf van de Google Analytics-component is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, VS.
De beheerder gebruikt de extensie "gat.anonymizeIp" voor webanalyse via Google Analytics. Door middel van deze extensie wordt het IP-adres van de internetverbinding van het gegevenssubject afgekort en geanonimiseerd door Google indien de toegang tot onze internetsites gebeurt vanuit een lidstaat van de Europese Unie of van een ander land dat deel uitmaakt van de overeenkomst over de Europese Economische Ruimte.
Het doel van de Google Analytics-component is het analyseren van de bezoekersstroom aan onze website. Google gebruikt de verkregen gegevens en informatie onder andere om het gebruik van onze website te evalueren, online rapporten voor ons samen te stellen waarin de activiteiten op onze website staan en andere services te bieden in verband met het gebruik van onze website.
Google Analytics plaatst een cookie op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject. Welke cookies er zijn, is eerder al uitgelegd. Door de cookie te plaatsen, kan Google het gebruik van onze website analyseren. Telkens een van de afzonderlijke pagina’s op deze website wordt geopend die worden beheerd door de beheerder en waarin een Google Analytics-component is geïntegreerd, zal de internetbrowser op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject door de overeenkomstige Google Analytics-component gegevens verzenden naar Google voor online analyse. Als onderdeel van dit technisch proces ontvangt Google informatie over persoonsgegevens, zoals bijvoorbeeld het IP-adres van het gegevenssubject dat Google gebruikt, zodat het de herkomst van bezoekers en de muisklikken kan tracken, zodat het commissieberekeningen kan maken.
Door middel van deze cookie, wordt persoonlijke informatie, bijvoorbeeld het tijdstip van de toegang, de plaats vanaf waar toegang is verkregen en de frequentie van de bezoeken aan onze website van het gegevenssubject, opgeslagen. Telkens het gegevenssubject onze website bezoekt, worden deze persoonsgegevens, inclusief het IP-adres van de door het gegevenssubject gebruikte internetverbinding, verzonden naar Google in de Verenigde Staten. Deze persoonsgegevens worden opgeslagen door Google in de Verenigde Staten. Google kan deze persoonsgegevens die zijn verzameld via de technische procedure verstrekken aan derde partijen.
Het gegevenssubject kan, zoals eerder al is uitgelegd, op eender welk moment voorkomen dat er door onze website cookies worden geplaatst door dat zo in te stellen in de internetbrowser die wordt gebruikt, en dus permanent te weigeren dat er cookies worden geplaatst. Door zo een instelling van de gebruikte internetbrowser zou Google ook geen cookie kunnen plaatsen op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject. Daarnaast kan een reeds door Google Analytics geplaatste cookie op eender welk moment worden gewist via een internetbrowser of andere softwareprogramma's.
Bovendien heeft het gegevenssubject de mogelijkheid om bezwaar te maken tegen het verzamelen van door Google Analytics gegenereerde gegevens en met betrekking tot het gebruik van deze website en tegen de verwerking van deze gegevens door Google en om een zulke verwerking te voorkomen. Daarvoor moet het gegevenssubject een browseradd-on downloaden en installeren via de link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Deze browseradd-on vertelt Google Analytics via JavaScript dat er geen gegevens en informatie over bezoeken aan internetpagina’s mogen worden verzonden naar Google Analytics. De installatie van deze browseradd-on wordt door Google beschouwd als een bezwaar. Indien het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject is verwijderd, geformatteerd of opnieuw is geïnstalleerd op een later moment, moet het gegevenssubject de browseradd-on opnieuw installeren om Google Analytics te deactiveren. Indien de browseradd-on is geïnstalleerd of gedeactiveerd door het gegevenssubject of een andere persoon binnen zijn of haar invloedssfeer, is het mogelijk de browseradd-on opnieuw te installeren of opnieuw te activeren.
Meer informatie en het toepasbare privacybeleid van Google staat op https://www.google.nl/intl/nl/policies/privacy en op http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/nl.html. Meer gedetailleerde informatie over Google Analytics via de link https://www.google.com/intl/nl_nl/analytics/.
#### 17. Privacybeleid inzake het gebruik en de toepassing van Google Remarketing
De beheerder heeft Google Remarketing-services geïntegreerd op deze website. Google Remarketing is een functie van Google AdWords waarmee een bedrijf advertenties kan tonen aan internetgebruikers die eerder de website van het bedrijf hebben bezocht. Door Google Remarketing te integreren, kan een bedrijf dus advertenties creëren die zijn afgestemd op de gebruiker en de internetgebruiker bijgevolg advertenties tonen in functie van zijn of haar interesses.
Het moederbedrijf van de Google Remarketing-services is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, VS.
Het doel van Google Remarketing is het tonen van advertenties in functie van de interesses van de gebruiker. Google Remarketing maakt het mogelijk advertenties te tonen via het Google-advertentienetwerk of die te tonen op andere internetpagina’s in functie van de individuele behoeften en interesses van de internetgebruiker. Google Remarketing plaatst een cookie op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject. Welke cookies er zijn, is eerder al uitgelegd. Door deze cookie te plaatsen, kan Google de bezoeker van onze website herkennen wanneer hij of zij daarna websites bezoekt die ook deel uitmaken van het Google-advertentienetwerk. Telkens een website wordt geopend waarin de Google Remarketing-service is geïntegreerd, identificeert de internetbrowser van de betroffen persoon zich automatisch bij Google. Binnen het bereik van deze technische procedure krijgt Google informatie over persoonsgegevens, zoals bijvoorbeeld het IP-adres of het surfgedrag van de gebruiker, die Google onder andere gebruikt om advertenties in functie van de gebruiker te tonen.
Met deze cookie wordt persoonlijke informatie opgeslagen, bijvoorbeeld de door de betroffen persoon bezochte internetpagina’s. Telkens het gegevenssubject onze website bezoekt, worden deze persoonsgegevens, inclusief het IP-adres van de door het gegevenssubject gebruikte internetverbinding, verzonden naar Google in de Verenigde Staten. Deze persoonsgegevens worden opgeslagen door Google in de Verenigde Staten. Google kan deze persoonsgegevens die zijn verzameld via de technische procedure verstrekken aan derde partijen.
Het gegevenssubject kan, zoals eerder al is uitgelegd, op eender welk moment voorkomen dat er door onze website cookies worden geplaatst door dat zo in te stellen in de internetbrowser die wordt gebruikt, en dus permanent te weigeren dat er cookies worden geplaatst. Door zo een instelling van de gebruikte internetbrowser zou Google ook geen cookie kunnen plaatsen op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject. Daarnaast kan een reeds door Google Analytics geplaatste cookie op eender welk moment worden gewist via een internetbrowser of andere softwareprogramma's.
Daarnaast heeft het gegevenssubject de optie bezwaar te maken tegen internetadvertenties van Google. Daarvoor moet het gegevenssubject klikken op de link www.google.nl/settings/ads vanaf een van de internetbrowsers die hij of zij gebruikt en daar de gewenste instelling maken. Meer informatie en de toepasbare bepalingen inzake gegevensbescherming van Google vindt u op https://www.google.nl/intl/nl/policies/privacy.
#### 18. Privacybeleid inzake het gebruik en de toepassing van Google AdWords
De beheerder heeft Google AdWords geïntegreerd op deze website. Google AdWords is een internetadvertentieservice waarmee adverteerders ads kunnen plaatsen in de resultaten van Googles zoekmachine en in het advertentienetwerk van Google. Met Google AdWords kan een adverteerder op voorhand bepaalde trefwoorden specificeren, waarna een advertentie uitsluitend in de zoekresultaten van de zoekmachine van Google wordt getoond wanneer de gebruiker met de zoekmachine een zoekresultaat krijgt dat relevant is voor het trefwoord . In het Google-advertentienetwerk worden de ads verdeeld over websites die relevant zijn voor het onderwerp door middel van een automatisch algoritme en in overeenstemming met de vooraf bepaalde trefwoorden.
Het moederbedrijf van de Google AdWords-services is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, VS.
Het doel van Google AdWords is onze website te promoten door advertenties te tonen in functie van de interesses van de gebruiker op de website van externe bedrijven en in de resultaten van de zoekmachine van de Google-zoekmachine, en om advertenties van derde partijen op onze website te tonen.
Wanneer een gegevenssubject onze website opent via een Google-advertentie, wordt er een zogenaamde conversiecookie opgeslagen door Google op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject. Welke cookies er zijn, is eerder al uitgelegd. Een conversiecookie is na dertig dagen niet meer geldig en wordt niet gebruikt om het gegevenssubject te identificeren. De conversiecookie wordt gebruikt om te tracken of bepaalde subpagina’s, bijvoorbeeld het winkelwagentje van een online winkelsysteem, zijn opgeroepen op onze website, op voorwaarde dat de cookie nog niet is vervallen. Door de conversiecookie kunnen zowel wij als Google volgen of een gegevenssubject dat op onze website terecht is gekomen via een AdWords-ad een verkoop heeft gegenereerd, d.w.z. een verkoop van goederen heeft voltooid of geannuleerd.
De door het gebruik van de conversiecookie verzamelde gegevens en informatie worden door Google gebruikt om bezoekersstatistieken voor onze website samen te stellen. Deze bezoekersstatistieken worden dan door ons gebruikt om het totaal aantal gebruikers te bepalen die bij ons terecht zijn gekomen via AdWords-ads, d.w.z. om te bepalen of de AdWords-ad al dan niet een succes was en om onze AdWords-ads te optimaliseren voor de toekomst. Noch ons bedrijf, noch andere adverteerders van Google AdWords ontvangen van Google informatie waarmee het gegevenssubject kan worden geïdentificeerd. Met deze conversiecookie wordt persoonlijke informatie opgeslagen, bijvoorbeeld de door het gegevenssubject bezochte internetpagina’s. Telkens het gegevenssubject onze website bezoekt, worden deze persoonsgegevens, inclusief het IP-adres van de door het gegevenssubject gebruikte internetverbinding, verzonden naar Google in de Verenigde Staten. Deze persoonsgegevens worden opgeslagen door Google in de Verenigde Staten. Google kan deze persoonsgegevens die zijn verzameld via de technische procedure verstrekken aan derde partijen.
Het gegevenssubject kan, zoals eerder al is uitgelegd, op eender welk moment voorkomen dat er door onze website cookies worden geplaatst door dat zo in te stellen in de internetbrowser die wordt gebruikt, en dus permanent te weigeren dat er cookies worden geplaatst. Door zo een instelling van de gebruikte internetbrowser zou Google ook geen conversiecookie kunnen plaatsen op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject. Daarnaast kan een reeds door Google AdWords geplaatste cookie op eender welk moment worden gewist via een internetbrowser of andere softwareprogramma's.
Daarnaast heeft het gegevenssubject de optie bezwaar te maken tegen internetadvertenties van Google. Daarvoor moet het gegevenssubject klikken op de link www.google.de/settings/ads vanaf een van de internetbrowsers die hij of zij gebruikt en daar de gewenste instelling maken. Meer informatie en de toepasbare bepalingen inzake gegevensbescherming van Google vindt u op www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.
#### 19. Privacybeleid inzake het gebruik en de toepassing van Twitter
De beheerder heeft componenten van Twitter geïntegreerd op deze website. Twitter is een meertalige, publiek toegankelijke microbloggingservice waarop gebruikers kunnen publiceren en zogenaamde tweets kunnen versturen, d.w.z. Korte berichten met een tekenlimiet van 280 tekens. Deze korte berichten kan iedereen zien, ook personen die niet geregistreerd zijn bij Twitter. De tweets worden echter ook getoond aan de zogenaamde volgers van de gebruiker. Volgers zijn andere Twitter-gebruikers die de tweets van een gebruiker volgen. Daarnaast maakt Twitter het mogelijk om een breed publiek te bereiken door middel van hashtags, links of retweets.
Het moederbedrijf van Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, VS.
Telkens een van de afzonderlijke pagina’s op deze website wordt geopend die worden beheerd door de beheerder en waarin een Twitter-component (Twitter-knop) is geïntegreerd, zal de internetbrowser op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject door de overeenkomstige Twitter-component van Twitter een voorstelling downloaden van de overeenkomstige Twitter-component. Meer informatie over de Twitter-knoppen vindt u op https://about.twitter.com/nl/resources/buttons. Binnen het bereik van deze technische procedure ontvangt Twitter informatie over welke specifieke subpagina van onze website wordt bezocht door het gegevenssubject. Het doel van de integratie van de Twitter-component is het onze gebruikers mogelijk te maken om content van deze website te verspreiden, deze website bekend te maken in de digitale wereld en een groter bezoekersaantal te krijgen.
Indien het gegevenssubject op hetzelfde moment is aangemeld bij Twitter, herkent Twitter welke specifieke subpagina van onze website het gegevenssubject aan het bezoeken is telkens het gegevenssubject onze website oproept, en dit zolang hij op onze website blijft. Deze informatie wordt verzameld door de Twitter-component en wordt door Twitter toegewezen aan het overeenkomstige Twitter-account van het gegevenssubject. Indien het gegevenssubject een van de geïntegreerde Twitter-knoppen op onze website activeert, zullen de verzonden gegevens en informatie worden toegewezen aan het persoonlijke Twitter-gebruikersaccount van het gegevenssubject en worden opgeslagen en verwerkt door Twitter.
Twitter ontvangt de informatie dat het gegevenssubject onze website heeft bezocht altijd via de Twitter-component indien het gegevenssubject tegelijkertijd is aangemeld bij Twitter wanneer deze onze website bezoekt; dit gebeurt ongeacht of het gegevenssubject op de Twitter-component klikt. Indien het gegevenssubject wenst dat deze informatie niet verzonden wordt naar Twitter, kan hij of zij deze verzending voorkomen door zich af te melden van zijn of haar Twitter-account alvorens onze website te openen.
De toepasbare bepalingen inzake gegevensbescherming van Twitter staan op https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=nl.
#### 20. Privacybeleid inzake het gebruik en de toepassing van YouTube
De beheerder heeft YouTube-componenten geïntegreerd op deze website. YouTube is een internetvideoportaal waarop gratis video’s kunnen worden gepubliceerd en andere gebruikers deze kunnen bekijken, beoordelen en er commentaar op kunnen geven, en dit eveneens gratis. Op YouTube kunnen alle soorten video’s worden gepubliceerd. Dit is waarom volledige film- en tv-shows, maar ook muziek, video’s, trailers of video's gemaakt door gebruikers kunnen worden bekeken via het internetportaal.
Het moederbedrijf van YouTube is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube, LLC is een dochtermaatschappij van Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, VS.
Telkens een van de afzonderlijke pagina’s op deze website wordt geopend die worden beheerd door de beheerder en waarin een YouTube-component (YouTube-video) is geïntegreerd, zal de internetbrowser op het informatietechnologiesysteem van het gegevenssubject door de overeenkomstige YouTube-component van YouTube een voorstelling downloaden van de overeenkomstige YouTube-component. Meer informatie over YouTube vindt u op https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/nl/. Binnen het bereik van deze technische procedure ontvangen YouTube en Google informatie over welke specifieke subpagina van onze website wordt bezocht door het gegevenssubject.
Indien het gegevenssubject op hetzelfde moment is aangemeld bij YouTube, herkent YouTube welke specifieke subpagina van onze website het gegevenssubject aan het bezoeken is door een subpagina op te roepen met een YouTube-video. Deze informatie wordt verzameld door YouTube en Google en wordt toegewezen aan het overeenkomstige YouTube-account van het gegevenssubject.
YouTube en Google ontvangen de informatie dat het gegevenssubject onze website heeft bezocht altijd via de YouTube-component indien het gegevenssubject tegelijkertijd is aangemeld bij YouTube wanneer deze onze website bezoekt; dit gebeurt ongeacht of het gegevenssubject op een YouTube-video klikt. Indien het gegevenssubject wenst dat deze informatie niet verzonden wordt naar YouTube en Google, kan hij of zij deze verzending voorkomen door zich af te melden van zijn of haar YouTube-account alvorens onze website te openen.
Het door YouTube gepubliceerde privacybeleid, dat geraadpleegd kan worden op https://www.google.nl/intl/nl/policies/privacy/ bevat informatie over het verzamelen, verwerken en gebruiken van persoonsgegevens door YouTube en Google.
#### 21. Betaalmethode: Privacybeleid voor Payone als betaalmethode met creditcard
Indien u beslist om met creditcard voor uw reis te betalen, zullen uw persoonsgegevens worden verzonden naar Payone. De wettelijke basis voor de verzending van de gegevens is Artikel 6 (1) a GDPR (toestemming) en Artikel 6 (1) b GDPR (verwerking voor de uitvoering van een overeenkomst) van PAYONE GmbH, Lyoner Straße 9, 60528 Frankfurt am Main, Duitsland. E-mail: privacy@payone.com
Door te betalen met creditcard stemt u in met de verzending van uw persoonsgegevens zoals naam, e-mailadres en creditcardgegevens naar Payone. Welke andere gegevens er worden verzameld door Payone staat in hun privacybeleid: https://docs.payone.com/display/public/PLATFORM/Privacy+Policy
#### 22. Wettelijke basis voor verwerking
Artikel 6 I lit. a GDPR dient voor ons bedrijf als de wettelijke basis voor het verwerken van transacties, waarbij we toestemming krijgen voor een specifiek verwerkingsdoel. Indien de verwerking van persoonsgegevens noodzakelijk is voor het uitvoeren van een overeenkomst waarvan het gegevenssubject deel uitmaakt, bijvoorbeeld bij het verwerken van transacties die nodig zijn voor een levering van goederen of het leveren van een andere dienst of tegenprestatie, verloopt de verwerking op basis van Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. Hetzelfde geldt voor zulke verwerkingen die nodig zijn voor het implementeren van precontractuele maatregelen, bijvoorbeeld in geval van vragen over onze producten of services. Indien ons bedrijf onderworpen is aan een wettelijke verplichting waarvoor het nodig is persoonsgegevens te verwerken, zoals voor het voldoen aan belastingplichten, is de verwerking gebaseerd op Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In uitzonderlijke gevallen kan de verwerking van persoonsgegevens nodig zijn om vitale belangen van het gegevenssubject te beschermen of van een andere natuurlijke persoon. Dit zou bijvoorbeeld het geval zijn wanneer een bezoeker gewond raakt op onze terreinen en als gevolg zijn of haar naam, leeftijd, ziekteverzekeringgegevens of andere vitale informatie aan een arts, ziekenhuis of andere derde partij moet worden bezorgd. De verwerking is dan gebaseerd op Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Ten slotte kunnen verwerkingen gebaseerd zijn op Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR.
Verwerkingen die niet worden gedekt door een van de eerder vermelde wettelijke basissen zijn gebaseerd op deze wettelijke basis indien de verwerking noodzakelijk is om een legitiem belang te beschermen van ons bedrijf of van een derde partij, op voorwaarde dat de belangen, fundamentele rechten en vrijheden van het gegevenssubject niet prevaleren. Zulke verwerkingen in het bijzonder zijn voor ons toegestaan, omdat ze specifiek zijn vermeld door de Europese wetgever. In deze zin is men van oordeel dat van een rechtmatig belang kan worden uitgegaan indien het gegevenssubject een klant is van de beheerder (punt 47, zin 2 GDPR).
#### 23. Rechtmatige belangen inzake de verwerking door een beheerder van een derde partij
Indien de verwerking van persoonsgegevens is gebaseerd op Artikel 6 I lit. f GDPR, is ons rechtmatig belang de uitvoering van onze zakelijke activiteiten ten voordele van en voor het welzijn van al onze werknemers en aandeelhouders.
#### 24. Duur waarvoor de persoonsgegevens worden opgeslagen
De criteria voor de opslagduur van persoonsgegevens is de respectieve wettelijke bewaarperiode. Nadat deze periode is verstreken, worden de betroffen gegevens routinematig verwijderd, op voorwaarde dat ze niet langer nodig zijn voor het uitvoeren van de overeenkomst of het starten van de overeenkomst.
#### 25. Wettelijke of contractuele vereisten voor het verstrekken van persoonsgegevens; noodzaak voor het sluiten van een overeenkomst; verplichting van het gegevenssubject om persoonsgegevens te verstrekken; mogelijke gevolgen van het niet verstrekken van de gegevens


We informeren u dat het verstrekken van persoonsgegevens soms bij wet verplicht is (bijv. belastingregelgevingen) of ook kan voortvloeien uit contractuele regelgevingen (bijv. Informatie over de contractpartner). Soms kan het om een overeenkomst te sluiten nodig zijn dat een gegevenssubject ons persoonlijke gegevens bezorgt die vervolgens door ons moeten worden verwerkt. Het gegevenssubject is bijvoorbeeld verplicht ons persoonsgegevens te verstrekken indien ons bedrijf een overeenkomst met hem of haar sluit. Indien deze persoonsgegevens niet kunnen worden verstrekt, kan de overeenkomst niet worden gesloten met het gegevenssubject. Voordat het gegevenssubject persoonsgegevens verstrekt, moet het gegevenssubject contact opnemen met een van onze werknemers. Onze werknemer zal het gegevenssubject voor het specifieke geval informeren of het verstrekken van persoonsgegevens bij wet of contractueel verplicht is of noodzakelijk is voor het sluiten van de overeenkomst, of er een verplichting is om persoonsgegevens te verstrekken en wat de gevolgen zouden zijn indien de persoonsgegevens niet worden verstrekt.
#### 26. Orderverwerkers
We gebruiken externe serviceproviders (orderverwerkers), bijv. voor het zenden van nieuwsbrieven, het verwerken van creditcardbetalingen of reisprogramma's. Met de serviceprovider is een afzonderlijke overeenkomst inzake het verwerken van ordergegevens gesloten om de bescherming van uw persoonsgegevens te waarborgen.
Indien u wilt weten met welke serviceproviders wij werken, kan u een lijst bij ons aanvragen. Stuur ons daarvoor een e-mail naar gegevensbescherming@venturatravel.org, wij verzenden u dan de gevraagde informatie.
#### 27. Disclaimer
Ondanks een grondige controle van de inhoud aanvaarden wij geen aansprakelijkheid voor alle externe links op onze website. Op het moment dat de links werden geplaatst, bleek er geen illegale content te zijn op de externe pagina's. Maar aangezien we geen invloed hebben op het huidige en toekomstige ontwerp van externe sites, doen we hierbij uitdrukkelijk afstand van de content ervan.
#### 28. Bestaan van geautomatiseerde beslissingmaking
Als een verantwoordelijk bedrijf maken we geen gebruik van geautomatiseerde beslissingmaking of profilering. Deze verklaring inzake gegevensbescherming is aangemaakt door de maker van de verklaring inzake gegevensbescherming van DGD Deutsche Gesellschaft für Datenschutz GmbH, die optreedt als de externe gegevensbeschermingsinstantie Dachau, in samenwerking met de advocaat voor de wet inzake gegevensbescherming Christian Solmecke.
